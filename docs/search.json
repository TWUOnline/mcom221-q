    "text": "Overview\nIn Unit 3 you created visual compositions with your camera. We hope you found it exciting to go out and explore your world through a lens and design a creative still image.\nIn this Unit you begin your journey into the world of motion pictures. At heart, film (and video) is a temporal medium. It involves a series of images that unfold over time, most often at the rate of 24, 25, or 30 frames per second. This rate of frame-flow gives film its sense of moving pictures where a series of single frame images of a galloping horse look like the horse is actually running. This is why film is considered a kinetic medium where moving people and objects take center stage.\nWe began with still photos in the previous unit because they are easier to control and to frame. In this unit we are going to add motion to what we compositionally frame. This will bring a lot more variables to image creation and make it more exciting for many people. As you focus on motion you must not be tempted to forget the lessons learned in the previous unit. Many of the same composition elements and principles will apply and the wise student will refresh his or her self with Unit 3 before engaging the activities for this unit.",

    "text": "4.1 Types of Cinematic Motion Shots\nIn Unit 3 we explored how excellent or effective still (non-moving) visual compositions are made. The elements and principles of such images apply to filmmaking too. However, film and video add new variables and techniques given that they deal with moving or motion pictures.\nHowever, as we explore film motion, we must remember that film and video involve a series of still images being projected and that persistence of vision makes them appear connected. (See the first Helpful Hint in the course text Chapter 4.) This is why we need to incorporate what we have learned about visual composition as we create our “moving” pictures.\nThe main types of motion shots include:\n\nZOOMS\nPAN SHOTS\nSWISH OR WHIP PAN\nTILT SHOTS\nDOLLY\nDOLLY ZOOMS\nTRACKING\nARCING\nFOLLOW SHOTS\nCRANE SHOTS\n360-DEGREE TRACKING SHOTS\nSLIDERS\nGOPRO\nDRONES\nSHAKY CAMERA\n\n\n4.1.1 Activity: Motion Shots Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nStudy Chapter 4 of course e-text: Digital Filmmaking: A Beginner’s Guide to Mastering the Craft. This chapter will help you understand the different types of motion shots. Be sure to take notes and begin logging and identifying shot ideas you want to try and practice. Actively taking notes as you read is a great way to absorb the material.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Activity: Motion Shots Practice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nStudy the definitions of the main types of motion shots and how to do them. Then practice doing as many of them as you can. (Obviously you cannot do a GoPro or drone shot without that specific equipment, but you might be imaginative and find an alternative to do a similar type of shot.)\nWrite in your journal your observations about each type of shot and what you learned from doing them.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Activity: Watch and Learn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nBefore moving on to the next topic, watch the video “5 Brilliant Moments of Camera Movement” to augment your understanding of camera movement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Do not try doing zoom shots with your cell camera unless you have a special app that makes it smooth. Squeezing your finger in and out to move closer or further away from your subject will result in a shaky shot. Our goal is to disguise movement, not to draw attention to it.",

    "text": "4.2 Properly Motivated Camera Moving Shots\nA classical approach to filmmaking involves using shot and techniques that are motivated by the characters and story and which do not unnecessarily distract or pull the audience out of experiencing an event in your film. Put another way, if you do something that is jarring or not done well such as a shaky zoom shot it will draw attention to itself and distract the audience and prevent them from engaging the flow of your scene. What this means will become apparent as you progress in the course.\nThe following sections will help you have properly motivated and framed movement within the frame.\n\nProperly Motivated Movement Shots\nProper Placement in the Frame\nMotivated Unmotivated Camera Movement\n\n\n4.2.1 Activity: Proper Motivation Exercise and Practice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nAfter you have viewed the resources and studied the properly motivated camera movements, find someone to film and practice each of the techniques with your cell phone.
