    "text": "Overview\nWelcome to MCOM 221! You are about to embark on a creative adventure. The specific goal of this journey is to create attention-grabbing and alluring short films. However, the general goal is far more valuable as you learn things about yourself you never knew. This course will equip you with the knowledge to develop transferable life skills that will help you in your career and professional life after you complete your education.\nIn addition, there is a larger element of this course that connects us to people from the past, present, and future. Namely, storytelling.\nAccording to communications theorist Walter Fischer, human beings are more than Homo sapiens, we are Homo narrans, man the storyteller. Storytelling is hardwired into our brains and our cultures and history. Stories are how we make sense of our life and our world. This is why religion, philosophy, literature, and myth have been vital to human culture and understanding. Even science is a story—it tells us how the world works. But it cannot tell us why. Only story-based meaning can reveal why life is important, how we should live our lives, and why there is something rather than nothing. Think of the Bible. If one were to take out the stories, it would be a thin book.\nDon’t let these ideas scare you. This is a creative course not a philosophic one. The point here is that as you increase your storytelling skills—a vital part of this course—you will join the community of narrators throughout human history who have shared their wisdom, insight, and understanding. This knowledge serves as the foundation for building identities, developing traditions, and discovering the types of meaning that make life worth living across all cultures.\nThis course will focus on one aspect of narratives, namely visual storytelling. How do we use pictures (and sounds) to create meaning and emotionally connect people to ourselves and each other? This will be the deeper theme operating beneath the surface of this course. (In film terms it will be the subtext beneath the text.)\nIn practical terms, the better you are at communicating stories (relative to each profession), the better you will be at your job. Fasten your seat belt, you are about to find out why we have focused on the above to start this course.",

    "text": "1.1 Course Introduction\nWe begin Unit 1 marvelling at the magic of film and cinema. (Read the course text Preface.) The ability of visually-centered storytelling to cross cultures and to captivate, educate, and entertain audiences is a universal contemporary phenomenon. For instance, how a series of flickering lights and images projected at 24, 25, and 30 frames a second can create emotions and experiences we all share is a wondrous mystery.\nLess mysterious is how this is done. There are techniques, rules, guidelines, and practices that can help us reach people in the ways that films, TV shows, streaming Internet programs, news, and the host of other visually-centered can make us laugh, cry, and emotionally move and engage us. The worst thing that can be said by an audience is that “I want my five, ten, sixty, or ninety minutes back (depending on the length of what we have viewed). Learning the methods to avoid this and to engage our audience will be central to this course.\nWHAT LIES AHEAD\nThis course will be divided up into ten segments or units. Each segment (or chapter) is self-contained but each section is inter-connected and vital for the others. A word to the wise—do note not skip a section, even if you think that you already know it. Each section of the course will build upon the previous one.\nSee the overview of the course and the ten units in the Introduction to the course text: Introduction to Digital Filmmaking: A Beginner’s Guide to Mastering the Craft.\nOf special note, Unit Ten and Chapter Ten will be a summary and a celebration of what you have learned during the course. It will also be a time for awards to be handed out for outstanding and excellent work such as Awards for Best film, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing., Best Story, and Most Imaginative and Most Improved Filmmaker, etc. This is noted here to give you a goal to work towards: namely, to win one of the top awards.\nAs can be gleaned from the above, this course will start with the most basic elements and proceed to creating a short film with a strong beginning, middle, and end. As you move through the course keep the mindset that this will be a fun, enjoyable, and exciting adventure.\n\n1.1.1 Activity: The Importance of the Film Journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this course you are encouraged to keep a “Film Journal.” This is important for many reasons, including helping you to brainstorm ideas, as well as ponder and process what you are learning. The journal will also help you to keep a record of your course activities, and note feedback of what does and does not work in film projects of your fellow course members. In addition, some of the exercises for this course will not be graded (for reasons that will be explained ahead) but this does not mean you will not be accountable for doing them. Your journal will be submitted at the end of the course and will play a role in the grade you receive. In short, students who engage with the course well will in general receive higher marks.\nAlso, note that you may be asked to use your journal entries to participate in discussions, presentations, and other learning activities in the FAR Centre Facilitated Learning Labs. Please check with your facilitator about specific due dates for activities, including journal responses.\nUnit 1 Film Journal Entry:\nBased on the importance of the course journal make your first two entries for this unit:\n\nEntry One: After reading the course text Introduction, describe your best take-aways of what you have learned.\nEntry Two:Study the recommended how-to-write-a-journal resources and log what you learned from them and how it will help you during the course.\n\nHow to Start a Creative Journal\nWatch: How to Journal Every Day for Increased Productivity, Clarity, and Mental Health (Ragland, 2018) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Your journal entries do not have to be long but they should be detailed and specific enough to indicate that you have engaged the course material and projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Activity: Film Terms and Vocabulary Needed for this Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course text Introduction also draws attention to the fact that you will learn many new terms and concepts during this course and that it is important for you to find resources that you can consult throughout the course to re-enforce their meaning and application to the course. Several websites will be cited here such as:\n\n studiobinder movie film terms \nA more comprehensive glossary can be found at  Wikipedia’s Glossary of Motion Picture terms  ; and\n AMC Film Terms Glossary \n\nCommit to learning five new film terms each day by starting with A and going to Z. The more you focus on this the better you will do in the course. Don’t worry if you do not understand a term. We will be covering many of them during the course. The important thing is to become familiar with important film terms and vocabulary.\nQuestions to Consider\n\nWhy is this course important to you?\nWhat do you hope to learn and how can it aid your future?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Your journal entries do not have to be long but they should be detailed and specific enough to indicate that you have engaged the course material and projects.",

    "text": "1.2 Excellence and Professional and Personal Development\nThis course will focus on the classical approach to filmmaking, that is, making motivated film stories and executing them in ways that help audiences to fully engage the story and characters without unnecessary distractions. In doing so, the course has a lofty goal: to aim for excellence.\nExcellence means a high standard of being good. This is of course relative to being an Introductory course with students who are just beginning their filmmaking journey, or are taking this course as an elective. But like any course, if you shoot for an A you will do better than settling for average and mediocrity.\nExcellence is important in filmmaking because our competition is great. Film is a public medium. It is designed to be shown to audiences and the quality of our projects, like many things we do in life, will be judged whether we want them to be or not.\nOne of the transferable life skills of this course is to help us be more professional. Thus the more we shoot for excellence, the more we will develop abilities that will serve us better in our careers ahead.\nAt the same time we must not confuse excellence with perfection. Our beginning films and projects will have lots of mistakes and things that do not work. This should not deter us from our goal of excellence. All great artists, athletes, business leaders, and a host of other professional make mistakes. The key is to learn from them and to keep improving our craft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHELPFUL HINT: For insight into how great artists, athletes, and performers use mistakes to grow in their art and craft see the following book by Daniel Coyle: The Talent Code: Greatness Isn’T Born. It’S Grown. Here’S How (“The Talent Code,” n.d.).\n\n\n\nOur goal then is to learn how to seek to produce visually-driven, digital film stories that are technically and artistically proficient, meaningfully engaging, motivated, and fraught with excellence.\nAs you can see excellence and professionalism go hand in hand. In order to grow and excel in a craft we need to grow and excel at being professional. Implied here is that we also need to mature and grow personally as we develop the character traits necessary for being a mature, moral, and responsible person.\n\n1.2.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Chapter One “Project Excellence and Professionalism” in the course textbook.\nAs you study and ponder what excellence and what professional and personal development mean, log in your journal why they are important and how you hope to focus on them during the course. Which character traits are your strongest and which do you need to work on? How will you do this? To help you with these entries study this resource:\nHow To Grow Professionally (Keiser, 2018)",

    "text": "1.3 15 Tips for Doing Your Best\nThe following will help you to not just do well in this Film project, but will make it fun and more enjoyable and hopefully be one of your favourite courses ever:\n\nKeep your eye on the prize. Creating an excellent project and growing as a professional and better person through the process.\nMeeting Deadlines. Being on time is vital in any profession, especially in filmmaking where the cost of feature film shoots can be thousands of dollars per hour. Plan your time and schedule accordingly so that you make your due date. Failure to do so will result in reduced marks on your assignment.\nAvoiding Distractions. In our Internet-cell phone era we are inundated and surrounded by 24/7 distractions. If we succumb to them we will not meet our deadlines and thus delay our professional and personal development. Learning to discern what is vital and what is the tyranny of the unimportant and unnecessary urgent is a critical skill to develop today. Focus on it and you will go further in the course. (Tip: turn off all notifications on your cell phone. In fact, turn off or put your cell phone away while you are working on your Film course. You will find that this will help you to focus on and finish your assignments quicker and with more creativity).\nFocussing on the positive. Most of the assignments ahead will be challenging. Cultivate a “can do attitude.” For context think about your taking a piano lesson course. You would not expect to sit down and immediately play chords and songs. You would have to learn to play the notes, then chords, then songs over a period of time. Filmmaking is similar. There are notes to learn (film shots), chords to learn (film scenes), before we can create melodies (film sequences) and songs (full films).\nIt takes time and practice to master film. If you find you have time, or if you are truly interested in learning the world of film or becoming a filmmaker, I encourage you to go beyond the course exercises. For example, continue to find and shoot interesting visual compositions (they are all around you) during the course, or practice fascinating and more complicated motion shots and two and three person shots. The more you do this the faster you will grow in your craft. Think about musicians. They practice over and over everyday.\nStudy the practical tips and helpful hints in these units. Pay attention to them. They will help fast-track your skills growth.\nFind and do what you love. During this course you will discover things you love to do and those that you do not. As a filmmaker, every skill set is vital for the final production – but you will discover which roles you are better at and enjoy the most. Even if you do not go into filmmaking as a career this self-insight will be invaluable as you make life decisions ahead.\nMake a firm commitment to succeed. When we are double-minded or not sure of what we want, we will waiver and fall prey to distraction and self-sabotage. Resolve not to give up as you make your projects despite what “Murphy’s Law” tosses your way. (To be covered later.)\nStrive for balance. The emphasis on excellence and professional and personal development must not make us “lose our soul.” Too many people get caught up in goals and ambition and end up failing in their marriage and relationships. Remember we are physical, mental, spiritual, emotional, and relational beings and must find a balance that lets us grow in each part equally. This is the key to personal flourishing.\nCreate strong and healthy relationships. During this course you will discover a lot about yourself and others. Some people will be easy to work with and some won’t. Some will be diligent and some won’t. Choose your teammates wisely and if you have a winning rapport with them, you might want to work with them on the next project. One of the keys to success in the professional world is cultivating strong and fruitful relationships. Start the process here.\nFollow your intuition. If you’ve never experimented with following your deeper instincts or “gut feelings” try it during this course. Often this will take you to new creative places. It might not always work but you will learn a lot from doing so.\nTake risks. We don’t grow unless we try new things and fail. They key is not to get discouraged but to shake off a loss and fight to win again.\nPractice, practice, practice. Learn, learn, learn. Your best competition is continually practicing and learning their craft. So should you. You need to cultivate both a strong work ethic and a smart ethic. Take the time to think things through before launching into something.\nTake responsibility for yourself and your future. Playing the blame game or the victim or continually making excuses will not get you ahead in life.\nFind inspiring quotes and pin them to your computer or wall. Most of us need encouragement especially when the going gets tough. Seek out inspiration that helps keep you going. The following strike some of the themes of this course:\n\n\n“Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.” - Winston S. Churchill\n\n\n“It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.” - Herman Melville\n\n\n“You will become clever through your mistakes.” - German Proverb in “The Talent Code”\n\n\n1.3.1 Activity: Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the tips in this section appeal to you most? Which do you need to focus on during the course? Write your response in your journal and share with your facilitator and/or classmates which are most important and why. Find an inspiring quote and share it with your peers.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nFilmmaking is exciting. We get to create and challenge ourselves as we make projects that can wow and inspire people. It is also a challenging art and craft. Film as a medium incorporates many other arts such as acting (like theatre); sets and production design (like painting and architecture); rhythm and timing (like music); scripts (like literature); movement (like dance), plasticity of form (like sculpture); as well as its unique combination of these many other arts.\nGiven the many skills needed to make a great film over time, filmmakers have devised a system to make it easier for filmmakers. This process is so well honed that some filmmakers, like experimental filmmakers, can do it all: produce, direct, act, shoot, and edit their film. However, the larger the film production and the bigger the budget, the more complicated the process becomes and the more people need to do it.\nLike in a story that has a beginning, middle and end, the filmmaking process is divided into three sections or segments: pre-production, production, and post-production. (There is a fourth component dealing with marketing and distribution, but this will not be covered in this course.) We start with an overall look at the filmmaking process. This will give us the big picture of what will lie ahead so that we do not get lost in the details of the many elements of filmmaking, and so that we can place what we will be doing and practicing in a larger framework.",

    "text": "2.1 The Three Phases of Filmmaking\nIn Unit 1 we focused on project excellence and great storytelling and why they are important. This unit will help obtain these goals by breaking the filmmaking process down into three phases. Each phase depends upon the other and if we fail to understand and execute each one well, the other phases and the film itself will suffer.\nThe overall filmmaking process has not changed much over the past century. In short, it involves three phases: Pre-Production—preparing to shoot a project; Production—shooting or filming the project; Post-Production—editing or putting all of the production elements together in a unified final project.\nUnderstanding these three phases is vital to making a great film. You will not have to master each phase, no one can because there are too many elements and skills involved depending on the complexity of the film, its story, and its execution.\n\n2.1.1 Activity: Shooting a Film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a visual representation of the overall filmmaking process view the following resource:\nWatch: Shooting a film - START to FINISH! (D4Darious, 2018)\n\nDon’t worry if you do not know all of the terms he is using such as blocking, dolly, tilt up, etc. These terms will be covered in the units ahead. For now, just take in the whole process and you will be amazed how much easier it will be to understand the later units as you explore the details of each phase.\nFor now, just watch the video and enjoy the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful Hint: Don’t multi-task during the viewing of resources. It will divide your attention and you will not absorb as much content. As with most things in this course—be in the moment and focus on what is at hand.",

    "text": "2.2 Pre-Production\nLike most things in life, if you do not have a strong foundation, what follows after will wobble. Proper pre-production is the foundation of an excellent film (and your up-coming exercises). The better you plan something, the better the result.\nThere are many elements to pre-production. When followed properly they enhance the 5 Cs of successful filmmaking (see the Why Pre-Production is Important section in Chapter 2 of the course text):\n\nCreativity\nCalmness\nCo-ordination\nCoherence\nConsistency\n\nProper pre-production involves many important general steps (see What Proper Pre-Production Entails section in Chapter 2 of the course text).\n\nPlanning\nAnticipation\nStrategizing\nTesting\n\nAs can be gleaned from above, pre-production helps ensure that a film project maximizes the creative process and minimizes chaos, confusion, and uncertainty—the enemies of a good film.\nThere are many steps in the prep-production process highlighted in Chapter 2. (See Successful Steps of Pre-Production.)\nThey involve:\n\nCreating a viable concept for a project\nKnowing who the audience is and genre requirements (people who like comedy want to laugh, people who like horror want to be scared)\nCreating a script to film\nCreating storyboards and shot lists\nPitching your project to get funding, actors, crew members, etc.\nBudgeting the cost of the film\nGetting your actors and the right crew\nFinding locations and props\nScheduling the shoot\nTesting your gear to make sure you know how to use it and that it works properly.\n\nAs can be seen, there is a lot involved before we film. Luckily, we will start with short exercises which will take minimal pre-production and gradually build to the more detailed aspects later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The lion’s share of this unit and Chapter Two in the course book is devoted to pre-production to emphasize how important this phase is. Most people might think production is the most important part of the filming process. In fact, each phase is. In Hollywood the development process (creating the screenplay) and pre-production for a film often takes far longer than production. Post-Production is also a longer process than production when a major film is involved.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Activity: Pre-Production Planning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the Pre-Production section of the course text. What part of the pre-production process appeals to you most? Why? Log this in your journal and share your responses with your facilitator and classmates when you meet for this unit.\nView this resource and share with your facilitator and course mates why pitching is important:\n\nWatch: Pitching and Pre-Production: Crash Course Film Production with Lily Gladstone (CrashCourse, 2017)\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nMurphy’s Law states that “what can go wrong will go wrong” but many people forget the last component “at the worse possible moment.” Have you ever experienced it?

    "text": "2.3 Production\nThe production phase involves the shooting of the film, what is often referred to as “principle photography”. (Sometimes pick-up shots, re-dos, and B-roll footage are done during post-production.) For many filmmakers this is the most exciting part of filmmaking when they get a chance to go on location and watch actors do their magic.\nLike pre-production, the production phase must be attended to thoughtfully and diligently or you will not have what you need to edit your film and make your story work. This is why a large portion of this course and the course text are dedicated to this phase of filmmaking, which will only be covered briefly here.\nIn addition to filming the actors, locations, action sequences, etc. production also includes recording on-location audio for the project. Capturing, recording, and creating good sound, like cinematography, takes lots of time and practice.\nMost of the production process takes place on real locations such as streets, schoolyards, restaurants, etc., and sets which are built for the filming. If you have the budget, filming on sets such as kitchens, living, rooms, police stations, etc. is easier than real locations. The reason for this is that you can control the lighting and use of space better and will not have extraneous and disruptive noises occurring in the environment.\nProduction can also include green screen and CGI (computer generated imagery) work, but these are normally for bigger budget productions since they are specialized skills and it’s costly to do them well. They are also time consuming. (If you have After Effects and other special effects software skills please consider using them in this course.)\nPerformance is a crucial part of the filming process. Many filmmakers forget this and get so caught up in the shooting process that they overlook or miss bad acting. Don’t fall into this trap. You want to work on having your actors deliver believable, motivated, non-melodramatic performances. More on this later.",

    "section": "2.4 Post-Production",
    "text": "2.4 Post-Production\nThe final phase of the filmmaking process involves post-production where all elements of pre-production and production are “cut” or stitched together to create a finished film.\nLike production, the post process is hands-on and labor intensive. If done digitally, it involves using software such as Adobe Premier Pro, Apple Final Cut, Avid, DaVinici Resolve, etc. to edit the footage and make transitions such as fades, dissolves, wipes, etc. (to be covered later). This can be easy but a lot of work goes into choosing the best and rights shots and editing them together.\nThere are four phases to cutting the picture of a film:\n\nAssembly Cut: where the shots are placed together in proper order without trimming them.\nRough Cut: where you begin to “trim the fat” from the beginning and end of shots to get a feel for how the story will flow.\nFine Cuts: which will involve multiple versions as you trim or cut shots and scenes that do not work. You can further hone the film of any “excess” fat that does not add to the effective presentation of the story and characters.\nFinal Cut: which is the “locked” picture version that the composer and sound design people need to add music and sound effects to precise moments in the story.\n\nIn addition to cutting the picture, post-production also entails:\n\nSound Design where the right music and sound effects are chosen and added.\nTitling and Graphics when the opening and ending film credits appear and any special written material that will appear on the screen such as: FIVE YEARS EARLIER.\nTest Screening your film to those you trust to make sure the story works and is clear, and to test how an audience will respond.\nColor Correcting where the flow of the color and light and dark nature of the images appears seamless and appropriate. This is where you correct over exposed and under expose shots or those with the wrong color temperature. (Look these terms up in the film glossary you are using during this course. Refer to Activity 1.2 in Unit 1)\nAudio Mixing which involves finding the right levels and balance between the sound elements such as dialogue, music, sound effects, room tone, etc.\nFormat Delivery: What resolution will you use to export your film project? The wrong one can undermine the quality of your film.As can be gleaned, there is a lot to post-production but by carefully studying and practicing the units ahead it will make it easier.\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed and intimidated, you will not be alone. This is a lot to do and learn and this is why the bigger film projects can be done with team members.\n\n2.4.1 Activity: Reflect and Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this unit and your reading of Chapter 2 in the course text, share in your journal why knowing the overall process is important and what you learned most from this unit.\nShare also if you are feeling intimidated. Remember all but one of the graded assignments will be done in teams so you will not have to do it all alone.",

As we grow in our filmmaking craft, we must continually be aware of what takes place within the frame (the border of a picture or a film shot). Focusing on a single image can help train us to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Tip: Before continuing below, study this overview of the building blocks of composition in art: The Visual Elements: The Building Blocks of Composition in Art\n\n\n\nThe following are some of the formal elements that make up the design and structure of an image. However, it is important to remember that subject matter and composition are linked and therefore do not get locked in to rigidly adhering to what you are learning. Many masters break the rules but they know them well before they do so.\n\nLine\nShape (geometric, organic, natural)\nColour (hues, intensities, symbolism)\nTexture (tactile feel)\nValue (shadows and shading)\nForm (3-D, 2-D)\nSpace (positive/objects); (negative/space between objects)\nDepth (foreground/mid-ground/background)",

We hope you found it exciting to go out and explore your world through a lens and design a creative still image.\nIn this Unit you begin your journey into the world of motion pictures. At heart, film (and video) is a temporal medium. It involves a series of images that unfold over time, most often at the rate of 24, 25, or 30 frames per second. This rate of frame-flow gives film its sense of moving pictures where a series of single frame images of a galloping horse look like the horse is actually running. This is why film is considered a kinetic medium where moving people and objects take center stage.\nWe began with still photos in the previous unit because they are easier to control and to frame. In this unit we are going to add motion to what we compositionally frame. This will bring a lot more variables to image creation and make it more exciting for many people. As you focus on motion you must not be tempted to forget the lessons learned in the previous unit. Many of the same composition elements and principles will apply and the wise student will refresh his or her self with Unit 3 before engaging the activities for this unit.",

The elements and principles of such images apply to filmmaking too. However, film and video add new variables and techniques given that they deal with moving or motion pictures.\nHowever, as we explore film motion, we must remember that film and video involve a series of still images being projected and that persistence of vision makes them appear connected. (See the first Helpful Hint in the course text Chapter 4.) This is why we need to incorporate what we have learned about visual composition as we create our “moving” pictures.\nThe main types of motion shots include:\n\nZooms\nPan Shots\nSwish Or Whip Pan\nTilt Shots\nDolly\nDolly Zooms\nTracking\nArcing\nFollow Shots\nCrane Shots\n360-Degree Tracking Shots\nSliders\nGopro\nDrones\nShaky Camera\n\n\n4.1.1 Activity: Motion Shots Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Chapter 4 of course e-text: Digital Filmmaking: A Beginner’s Guide to Mastering the Craft.

In this unit we are going to learn how to put them together with a variety of other shots to make cinematic context and meaning. This is the grammar of film used to make cinematic “sentences” which convey meaning and context to an audience as we create scenes, sequences, and short films.\nHowever, as we focus on the components of filmmaking, we must not let the emphasis only be on film logic. We also want to cultivate the role that intuition and feeling play as we develop shots and put them together. This reminder is important because filmmaking is as much art as technical craft. We need to know the craft—the technical aspects—but also the art—the aesthetic and emotional dimensions. We need to keep this before us as we venture into the many elements and guidelines of effective filmmaking.\nIn this first topic you will learn about:\n\nFrames\nShots\nScenes\nSequences\nActs\n\nThese components give you the big picture of how the many smaller elements add up to create mood and meaning in a film project.\n\n5.1.1 Activity: Read, and Explore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind and consult a film glossary such as Brooklyn College Film Glossary (Brooklyn College Film Department, n.d.).

The earlier exercises were not graded to give you the chance to explore and make mistakes, without regard to a grade. We now have to cross into that territory.

So this will be a great opportunity to learn to give and receive feedback.\nBut fear not.

You will shoot a short film with no dialogue in the exact sequential order that it will appear when you screen it for classs.\nAlmost always, films are shot out of sequence to save time and money by doing all the scenes in one location at a time and then all the scenes in another location at one time, etc.\nHere you will be forced to shoot at a location and move to the next, and if the first location is needed you will have to go back to it. Why do this? There are multiple benefits, as the course text chapter highlights. Some of them include:\n\nForcing you to think of a simple story that fits these parameters.\nChallenging you to plan your shots in a linear, well-thought out way.\nMaking you attentive to each shot and how relates to the previos ones.\nChallenging your brainstorming and film logic skills.\n\n\n6.1.1 Activity: Read, Study and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead and study Chapter 6. Write in your journal your initial thoughts regarding the benefits of doing an in-camera film. Does it thrill and excite you or make you apprehensive and anxious? Or maybe a combination of these feelings and emotions. As artists we need to get in touch with our feelings and learn to work with them not fear them.\nTo prime your imagination for the upcoming project, watch the video Visual Storytelling 101 \n\n\nWhat was your best take-away from it?

    "text": "6.3 Brainstorming and Successful Creativity\nThe secret to a story sounds simple and it is. We need to create a character with a goal and stakes (the painful consequences that will happen to the character) who has to overcome opposition to that goal and an ending that reveal whether or not the character obtains the goal.\nHowever, the challenge for most of us is, what story do I tell?\nBrainstorming is a great tool and way to discover and find the right story you want to tell. Brainstorming involves the spontaneous development of ideas. Brainstorming can be done alone or within a group.\nThe great thing about brainstorming is that you do not have to judge and criticize the process and results. In addition, you are not trying to perfect. You are only looking for that one idea that sparks your creativity and you ignore the others. This non-judgmentalism and jettisoning of perfectionism is important because these two tendencies stifle creativity.\nEven if you already have a story idea that you want to film you are strongly encouraged to engage in brainstorming activities during this section and the rest of the course. If you do, you unleash more of your creativity and you will most likely find a better story concept.\n\n6.3.1 Activity: Brainstorming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy the Brainstorming section in Chapter 6, including the Steps for Successful Brainstorming and the Tips for Success Creativity. Then consult these resources:\n\n30 Ways to Brainstorm Short Film Ideas You Can Actually Produce\n19 Great Ways to Brainstorm Short Film Ideas\n\nAfter you feel you have a good grasp of brainstorming, engage in the process and come up with 5 story concepts that fit the criteria in the previous topic:\n\nOne or two main characters.\nA single problem or conflict.\nKnowing your genre (will your film be funny, dramatic, scary, etc.?).\nA simple setting or number of locations.\nA satisfying ending. After you have done this go through your concept list and choose your top one and apply it to the template in the next topic.\n\nHelpful Hint: If you find yourself stuck and can’t come up with a story concept, tell your facilitator and have a group brainstorming session. Take one of the ideas and develop it. Share your concept if you are stuck finding one of the criteria such as a goal or stakes and ask for brainstorming help to solve the problem. Remember, film is mostly a collaborative venture.",

We also need to make sure we do not make it too complicated or muddled.\nMany of us have the tendency to overly complicate things: to add extraneous detail or to have elements that are not clear well explained. The template is this section is designed to prevent these issues as you use a fairy tale structure to find your characters, the problem they are facing, and show what happens in a clear way with a beginning, middle, and end of the story.\nHave fun with this template process. Also do not forget to use brainstorming for each section of the template so that you come up with the best characters, situations, locations, and conflict which are not predicable or have a “been there, done that” (boring) quality.\n\n6.4.1 Activity: Planning Your Film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have brainstormed and have a clear and solid concept film, e.g., a student who has the power to turn things in gold, use the Fairy Tale Template for a Short Film and write your story for your short film by filling in the blanks.\nStudy the illustration example given in the chapter and then apply the process to the creation of your film story. In crafting your story you are not allowed to use dialogue beyond “yes,” “no,” and “okay.” That is, you must find visual ways to establish your story’s setup and context and its build and payoff. For example, you cannot have your character say “I am on my way to the store.” You will just show him or her getting in the car, driving, arriving at the store parking lot, and entering the store. (This has visual direction vectors discussed below in Topic 3.)\nFairy Tale Template for a Short Film\n(This template is inspired by the one developed by Alexander Mackendrick. See On Filmmaking: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director. London: Faber & Faber, 2005, pgs. 78-85.)\nOnce Upon a Time _________. (Establish where your story will take place.)\nThere Lived a _____________. Establish the main character, hero, or protagonist.\nBut there was a Problem in the Land ____________. Establish the inciting incident that starts the story’s main conflict that the protagonist must face and overcome.\nThat the Hero had to Solve __________. Establish the main character’s drive, motive, goal, and stakes.\nBy Defeating a Villain or Evil Force __________. Establish the chief antagonist the protagonist has to overcome.\nThat resulted in Battles and Obstacles ___________. Establish the problems and difficulties the protagonist must overcome to achieve the goal.\nThe Result of Which ________. Establish the chain of cause and effect conflict events that form the middle of the story. These should escalate, that is, grow more intense and challenging as the action develops.\nProduced Twists and Turns __________. Establish the surprises and unexpected turn of events as the protagonist battles his or her foe.\nUntil the Time came that ________. Establish the obligatory scene or major confrontation or climax of the action.\nWhen Suddenly ___________. Establish the final major twist or surprise that heightens the action of the climax. This is optional.\nAnd it Turns Out that ______. Establish the resolution or wrapping up of the story.\nAnd Forever After (or Not) _________. Establish the end of the story and its closure which can be happy or sad.\nAre you happy with your story? Do you have to make revisions? You should go through at least three drafts of your story to make sure it works. Test your story out on you family and friends. Ask them if it works but remember they are not filmmakers or professional critics so ignore things when they are too petty or too subjective.\nRead through the section in Chapter 6 on creating a Short Story Film Template.\nBe sure to lay out your story in single lines of action that can be filmed as in the example of PANIC in Chapter 6.",

    "text": "Overview\nCongratulations. You’ve made your first mini-movie in this course. Don’t worry if it did not live up to your expectations. The important thing right now is that you wrote, produced, directed, and shot a short film and that you are improving your skills. The rest of your course will give you a chance to explore more elements of filmmaking and gain more experience.\nIn this unit you will focus on editing and creating a montage, a common form of filmmaking.\nUnlike the previous project, you can now use dialogue, voice over, music, and sound effects to enhance your short film project. You will also use editing which will allow you to shoot your film out of order and then assemble it after you have all of the elements you need to make it.\nAs you saw in Unit 2, editing is the third major phase of filmmaking and a major skill to understand.\nDon’t worry if you do not want to be an editor. You will work in teams this time and as long as the work on the film is shared equally between yourself and your partner(s), you can offer editing suggestions but will not have to push the buttons. (This is how it works in the industry where the director and producer tell the editor what they want and the editor does the technical work.)",

Digital video editing software is helpful because it allows you to edit your images and sync them to the rhythm and beats of your sound track and export your project for viewing or streaming on the Internet.\nThere are many types and brands of editing software in the marketplace and you will have to choose the one that works for you. Some applications only work with Android-based cellphones and others for Apple ISO devices and some for both platforms such as imovie. If you want to really get series about editing you should explore Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere, Avid, DaVinci Resolve, or some other professional program.\nThere are similarities among editing software and programs but you will have to do a tutorial on YouTube or the manufacture’s website of the one you will use to see how to work it. The more popular the software, the more tutorials will be available.\n\n7.5.1 Activity: Read, Study, and Explore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead and study Chapter 7, Digital Editing Software section. Next, Find the digital video editing program you want to use and learn how to do basic editing with it. Basic editing using cuts, dissolves, fades, and wipes titling will be all you need to learn for your montage project.\nThe Filmora website gives an overview of the type of features you want to look for. For free and inexpensive Android-based video software see:13 Best Android Video Editor Apps Of 2022 or search for best cellphone or DSLR video editing software such as Best video editing apps 2023\nNote: When you pitch your montage project, see who already has editing software and who knows how to use it and try to join with them if you are a bit of a “tech-phobic.” If you can’t find someone, challenge yourself and learn something new. You will learn and grow a lot doing this.",

    "section": "7.6 Pitching Your Montage Project",
    "text": "7.6 Pitching Your Montage Project\nBecause the montage project is more complicated, you are encouraged to work in teams to create an excellent montage. You can do the project solo if you feel you have the experience and understanding of the gear and software to create it.\nThe reason almost all larger-scale film projects are done in teams with a lot of different crew positions is that over time, people specialize in their skill-sets and bring better expertise to a project. This is why film crews have a cinematographer, production designer, wardrobe, hair and make-up specialists, prop masters, special effects experts, etc. (You should be consulting your film terms website if you do not know these positions.)\nFor this project, ideally you will have a team of two people. One to come up with the concept and film it and the other to edit it. In reality, both members will share the idea development, shooting, and editing. The important thing is that you both share equally in the work. (In some cases if the montage is highly complex or sophisticated you can have 3 or 4 members on the team as long as everyone does their fair share.)\nIn order to find the find teammate, you will pitch your project to the class to see who wants to work on it.\nPitching is a process central to the film and television industry. It involves an individual or team presenting their film project concept and why it is important and to a special audience such as a producer, agent, studio or television executive, distributor, film competition, etc. Everyone, no matter how big or important, has to pitch to those in the industry to find the money, resources, actors, crew, and/or distribution for their project.\nPitching is a vital part of filmmaking and it is a great transferable skill to learn since you will have to pitch in many professions and industries today.\n\n7.6.1 Activity: Pitching your Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will have to develop a montage concept to pitch such as a day in the life of street vendors, or a music video, or visualizing a poem or something from the Bible. So review the brainstorming techniques in the previous unit and come up with at least 10 concepts and then choose the one that most appeals to you.\nThen review the section on Pitching in Chapter Two of the course text. Study How to Pitch Your Montage Project and Steps for an Effective Pitch in the Chapter 7 and practice doing your pitch before a friend or family member or to an imaginary audience before making the actual pitch to your course members.\nNote: Do not skimp on practicing your pitch. The more you practice it you will gain confidence and know how to present your concept in an effective way.\nGuidelines for Pitching a Film Project\nPurpose of a Pitch: To get people to work on your project, commission your project, fund your project, help with your project, distribute your project, etc. Pitches also help you to clarity what you want to do and why.\nSteps to a Good Pitch\n\nIf you can, open with a teaser or dramatic statement or question.\nMeet and greet your audience—minimum chitchat, professionals are busy, busy people.\nDress appropriately—relative to the audience and the project. Artists dress “artsy”; corporate people dress with business attire.\nProject the proper persona (your personality and character)—knowledgeable, credible, trustworthy, smart, clever, etc.\nExplain your qualifications, background, and why you are competent and the right person to do the project. If you do not have a demo reel then sell people with your passion, e.g., WHIPLASH filmmaker.\nGive the title of the film/project—titles shape perception and expectations.\nState the Genre—comedy, drama, documentary, etc. This also shapes perceptions and expectations. The basic concept of a comedy should make us laugh or at lease smile.\nGive the Unique Angle or Hook of your project—what makes it stand out as something different and catchy/edgy/clever, etc. E.g., SHOE IN LOVE, a romantic comedy from the POV of a pair of cowboy boots and stilettos falling in love with each other. The special angle concept is to use foot ware as the main characters and the execution hook is to shoot POVs at foot level or from the shin down.\nBriefly state the logline or basic concept: a one or two sentence description of the core story. E.g., a young, bored dirt farmer gets a message that he has to help rescue a faraway princes and save the universe. STAR WARS.\nProject synopsis—succinctly tell the beginning/middle/end of your story or if a documentary the main message of your doc.\nSummarize your end goal: to wow my audience with extraordinary nature photography or to make my audience laugh, cry, fall in love, etc.\nExplain what you need—cast, crew, funding, etc.\nAsk for Questions—also be open to criticism and constructive comments and feedback.\nGratitude—be thankful and gracious even if your project is not received well or as anticipated. Burning bridges is wrongheaded. Pitching can be a training ground for how to deal with rejection.\n\nExamples of Types of Montage Projects to Pitch\nThe goal of your Montage Short assignment (see the syllabus) will be to explore how to make an effective montage-based film that uses picture and sound editing to convey meaning, emotion, story and/or mood.\nFor this project, you can:\n\nCreate a music video where you take a song and create images that express the mood, feeling, meaning, etc. of the song.\nFind a poem, fairy tale, or passage from the Bible and “visualize” and enhance it with music and sound effects.\nCreate a chase scene—someone steals something and is on the run and using music and sound effects to enhance the excitement and dynamism.\nCreate a love or horror or thriller story —use can use dialogue but there must be an edited montage—a series of edited shots that convey the mood, meaning etc.\nEtc.",

As we have seen, there are three main phases of film production and they will apply here:\n\nMontage Pre-Production\nMontage Production\nMontage Post-Production\n\nThe lion’s share of the emphasis in the chapter has been on post-production, but this does not mean you must take your pre-production and production work lightly. Your montage will only be as good as the images you have for it.\n\n7.7.1 Activity: Creating a Montage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy the next section of Chapter 7 on creating a montage. As you study montage pre-production, production, and post-production make notes on your shooting script of what to watch out for and not forget as you film the shots and images you will use.\n\n\n\n\n7.7.2 Activity: Feedback and Self-Assessment for Montage Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have edited your project and exported it, you are ready to show it to your classmates and instructor. This should be an exciting time as you screen the fruits of your labor and creativity.\nAs mentioned previously, film is a public medium and subject to critique and evaluation.\nThe following criteria can help us better evaluate our own work and that of others and to give constructive criticism on how to improve:\n\nOverall did the montage work?\nDid the music and/or sound effects work well with the images?\nDid the montage convey a mood, emotion, a story and/or theme (some insight into life)? If so, what was it?\nWere the shots well composed, motivated, and appropriately smooth or in some cases jarring depending on what is being communicated?\nWere the cuts timed well? If not, where did they not work well?\nWere the transitions appropriate and effective?\nWas the action followed well?\nWas there a sufficient variety of shots?\nWere some shots or images too repetitive?\nWere the shots and images interesting and noteworthy?\nWhat did you like best about the project?\nWhat suggestions would you offer to make it better?\n\nEvaluate and critique the work of your peers helping them to see what worked and did not work in their montage and why. When possible give suggestions of how something could have been done better. Remember the tone and substance of our critiques should be one that offers encouraging constructive insight and that helps each other to grow and improve their craft.\nFor insight into how to critique a short film watch the video Critiquing Your Short Films \n\nWrite in your journal what you learned about your project and yourself from the montage projects.\nUse the following questions to guide you:\n\nWhat was the best lesson I learned?\nWhat did I do well? Why?\nWhat did not work out as well as I planned? Why?\nWhat can I do better next time?\nWhat was the quality of my experience working with a partner?\nIf I did not work with a partner, could the project have been better if I had one?\nHow did this experience help me grow as a person and as a professional?\nWhat did I learn new about myself?\n\nBe sure to note which films and filmmakers had the best cinematography, editing, story, creativity, etc. so that you can consult this when you vote on the awards at the end of the course.",

    "text": "Overview\nMore kudos to you. You now have two film projects and a lot of film exercises in your experience bank account. You will now be moving up a level where you will have the opportunity to bring together all of what you have learned so far into a longer narrative film.\nIn the previous units you focused on how to make shorter films. In this unit and the next you will focus on creating longer forms where your film will be five to ten minutes in length. This might not seem long but the longer the film, the more you have to do to sustain interest and continually engage the audience. Mini-films (2-minutes and under) have less of this burden because an audience is not feeling like they are wasting a bigger chunk of their time if the film is not well done.\nNarrative films, whether fiction or non-fiction, are popular because they tell stories. Even if you do not want to be a “Hollywood” filmmaker learning to tell film stories will aid you in your personal and professional development. Human beings are hard-wired for storytelling. It is a primary way we make sense of the world and pass our knowledge and cultural values and traditions to others. Those who control the narratives of a society have powerful influence and impact.\nBefore moving ahead, view this resource:\nWatch: 7 Things to Know About Making Short Films! : FRIDAY 101",

Others of course rely on their intuition and passion. Either way, it is wise to see what those who distribute or stream and screen short films, such as festivals and competitions, look for in making their choices. Their criteria can you vet the quality of your story and its execution. See Film Shortage’s What Type Of Short Films Do We Prefer?",

Put another way, comedies need to be funny, horror films need to induce fear, romantic films need to inspire us to love, etc. Commercially, if these basic requirements are not met it can result in financial disaster and loss of reputation. At your level it will mean your film is not as effective as it could be.\nKnowing your genre will also help you develop your story and script in this and the following unit.\n\n8.2.1 Activity: Planning your Final Film Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in your journal what type of film you want to work on for your final film project and why.\nNext, view this list of loglines (short one line descriptions of a film story) in various genres: Popular Short film genres.\nWhich genre appeals to you most? Why? Log this reflection and start to brainstorm genre-based story concepts.\nTo improve your grasp of genre consult this resource:\nWhat Is Genre and How Is It Determined?",

    "text": "8.3 Logistics for the Final Film Project\nThis last film is a major project and will account for a lot of your grade given that it will reveal what you learned during this course. In light of this, you will need to create a strong story and the “blueprint” or script for filming it.\nTo save time so that you can put more of your energy into making the film, you will not have to develop a full screenplay (hence the scriptment section below) for the final project, but you are strongly encouraged to do so.\nHowever, this does not mean you do not have to pitch a core story concept (a basic story, its genre, and hook or unique angle) to the class. Everyone will be required to do this so that you can gain more experience with your creativity and your pitching skills.\nOnce you have created a story concept that inspires you, pitch it to the class to see if other classmates want to join you in your project and to get feedback on it. Once you have your team in place you will then follow the process for creating a shooting script for pre-production and production.\n\n8.3.1 Activity: Story Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next activity, you’ll be asked to brainstorm and develop a core story idea to pitch to the class.\nTo help you do this, follow the steps in Story Research Section of Chapter Eight and ask and answer the questions in the What to Look for Section. This should prime your creative pump for the next topic. Also view this helpful resource:\nWatch: How to Write a Short Film",

    "text": "8.4 Script and Story Development\nOur goal in this unit is to find and create a strong story to film. As we have seen, brainstorming is a great method to help do this.\nOnce you have created a story concept that inspires you pitch it to the class to see if other classmates want to join you in your project.\nOnce you have your team in place you will then follow the process for creating a shooting script for pre-production and production.\n\n8.4.1 Activity: Brainstorm and Prepare Your Pitch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrainstorm either alone or with a partner and come up with a story concept to pitch to the class. The goal of this activity is to do find a compelling story and to pitch it in a way that will attract the teammates you will need to make your longer film.\nHelpful Hint: Sometimes a title for your film can lend lots of inspiration. Professional screenwriters and Hollywood spend a lot of time finding the right title that captures the spirit of the film and can aid in marketing. Think Rebel Without A Cause, Slum Dog Millionaire, Vertigo, Dumb and Dumber, The Haunting, Groundhog Day, When Harry Met Sally.\nTo prepare for your pitch make sure you: - Know your genre. The story above could be a comedy, a drama, thriller, or a horror film. Which genre you decide will determine the following. - Establish your main characters. - Establish the main conflict. - Escalate the conflict. - Create some of the obstacles that will have to be overcome. - Have a clear beginning, middle, and end. - Know what crew members you will need and what they will do, e.g., a screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, editor, etc.\nMake sure the story is compressed, a la Aristotle’s Poetics, with a limited number of characters, locations, and action.\nHelpful Hint: Most of the short films that won or where nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film follow Aristotle’s idea of great drama and comedy: a few characters and locations and action that takes place over a brief amount of time. For a list of nominees and winners see: Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.\nAlso be prepared to explain what crew members you will need and what they need to do.\nMake your pitch to your classmates and then see who wants to join which team.\nIf your project is not chosen, that is, no one wants to work on it with you, you can still do it but know that it will be a lot of work.\n\nGuidelines for Pitching a Film Project\nPurpose of a Pitch: To get people to work on your project, commission your project, fund your project, help with your project, distribute your project, etc. Pitches also help you to clarity what you want to do and why.\nSteps to a Good Pitch\n\nIf you can, open with a teaser or dramatic statement or question.\nMeet and greet your audience—minimum chitchat, professionals are busy, busy people.\nDress appropriately—relative to the audience and the project. Artists dress “artsy”; corporate people dress with business attire.\nProject the proper persona (your personality and character)—knowledgeable, credible, trustworthy, smart, clever, etc.\nExplain your qualifications, background, and why you are competent and the right person to do the project. If you do not have a demo reel then sell people with your passion, e.g., WHIPLASH filmmaker.\nGive the title of the film/project—titles shape perception and expectations.\nState the Genre—comedy, drama, documentary, etc. This also shapes perceptions and expectations. The basic concept of a comedy should make us laugh or at lease smile.\nGive the Unique Angle or Hook of your project—what makes it stand out as something different and catchy/edgy/clever, etc. E.g., SHOE IN LOVE, a romantic comedy from the POV of a pair of cowboy boots and stilettos falling in love with each other. The special angle concept is to use foot ware as the main characters and the execution hook is to shoot POVs at foot level or from the shin down.\nBriefly state the logline or basic concept: a one or two sentence description of the core story. E.g., a young, bored dirt farmer gets a message that he has to help rescue a faraway princes and save the universe. STAR WARS.\nProject synopsis—succinctly tell the beginning/middle/end of your story or if a documentary the main message of your doc.\nSummarize your end goal: to wow my audience with extraordinary nature photography or to make my audience laugh, cry, fall in love, etc.\nExplain what you need—cast, crew, funding, etc.\nAsk for Questions—also be open to criticism and constructive comments and feedback.\nGratitude—be thankful and gracious even if your project is not received well or as anticipated. Burning bridges is wrongheaded. Pitching can be a training ground for how to deal with rejection.\n\nExamples of Types of Montage Projects to Pitch\nThe goal of your Montage Short assignment (see the syllabus) will be to explore how to make an effective montage-based film that uses picture and sound editing to convey meaning, emotion, story and/or mood.\nFor this project, you can:\n\nCreate a music video where you take a song and create images that express the mood, feeling, meaning, etc. of the song.\nFind a poem, fairy tale, or passage from the Bible and “visualize” and enhance it with music and sound effects.\nCreate a chase scene—someone steals something and is on the run and using music and sound effects to enhance the excitement and dynamism.\nCreate a love or horror or thriller story —use can use dialogue but there must be an edited montage—a series of edited shots that convey the mood, meaning etc.\nEtc.",

The following steps will help you prepare a shooting script that will make pre-production, production, and post-production flow better.\n\nCreate a step outline.\nCreate a scriptment.\n\nYour scriptment should be written in a way that someone who reads it should be able to visualize and hear your film.\n\n8.5.1 Activity: Creating a Scriptment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an overview of scriptments, consult this resource: Outlines, Treatments, and Scriptments, Oh My! by Ken Miyamoto.\nAs you do other drafts (good writing involves a lot of re-writing) to improve your story and polish your script so that everything is clear, it is helpful to ask the following questions. (These questions are designed for a fiction narrative film, though some of them can help vet your documentary or experimental film.) You might not have answers to all of them but you should for most of them. Again the emphasis in on helping you to be clear about your project.\n\nDo I have the right genre?\nDo I have a hook or is there something unique and fascinating about my story? It’s special angle.\nIs the story clear? A solid beginng, middle, and end?\nDo I focus on only a few characters and limited locations?\nAre my action and conflict unified and focused?\nDoes my main character have a goal?\nIs there an antagonist who or which wants to thwart that goal? (Remember, weather or a dog can be an antagonist.)\nAre their stakes or consequences for not obtaining the goal?\nAre there interesting obstacles to obtaining the goal?\nDo I have a set-up of the main character, problem, goal, and antagonist?\nDo I have some unexpected and unpredictable twists and turns in the middle section of my story?\nIs there a main conflict or battle that determines whether the main character gets his or her goal?\nDo I have a satisfying ending? (Remember not all endings have to be happy or closed. Open-ended endings are not resolved and make the audience guess, debate, and discuss what happened or might happen after).\n\nOnce you have your team and have developed the scriptment for your story, you can begin pre-production to get everything in place to film your project: e.g., cast, locations, props, gear, shooting schedule, etc.",

This is where higher-level creativity takes place.\nFilmmaking is like a language where you use the elements of grammar to make sentences. In this case, your shots to make scenes and the meaning the scenes will covey. The cumulation of sentences lead to paragraphs – the film equivalent of sequences, and the cumulation of paragraphs leads to sections (acts in film) and the cumulation of sections leads to your essay (in this case, your final film). You get the metaphor.\n\n9.1.1 Activity: Read, Watch and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead and study the first section of Chapter 9: The Syntax of Film.

    "text": "9.2 The Importance and Types of Camera Coverage\nExploring and understanding camera coverage is vital for those who want to create excellent films. Coverage refers to how a scene is captured. It involves how many shots are used and their type and kind to capture a scene in a film or video production. Coverage is thus the shot material an editor or post-production team will use to assemble the scenes and sequences of a movie. Having proper coverage is critical if a scene and a film is to make sense.\nThe are many questions that can guide you as you break down your film script to determine what coverage to use and how to shoot a scene. (Remember a scene can be one shot such as driving to the store, or a series of shots such as someone confronting a person to get information from him or her.) Take the time to study the Questions for Discovering Coverage section.\nCoverage can be done well or poorly. Our goal is the former.\nThere are two main types of general coverage: Master Shots and Mini-Masters. Knowing why these are important and when to use them will help guide you to the more detailed coverage and shots you will employ as as you develop the action of a scene.\nFilmmaking is not a “paint by numbers” art. If you follow formulas, most likely your film will be predicable and lack freshness. This is why understanding shot progression is important. Choosing the types of shots you will use and their order will form a large part of your visual creativity in your film.\n\n9.2.1 Activity: Read and Watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy the next section of Chapter 9 “The Importance and Types of Camera Coverage”. Next, watch the video What Is A Master Shot? \n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nExplain the value of why this type of shot can be beneficial as the first shot you do when you start your coverage of a scene? What is the downside of relying too much on a master shot?",
