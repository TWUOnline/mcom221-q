    "text": "Overview\nWelcome to MCOM 221! You are about to embark on a creative adventure. The specific goal of this journey is to create attention-grabbing and alluring short films. However, the general goal is far more valuable as you learn things about yourself you never knew. This course will equip you with the knowledge to develop transferable life skills that will help you in your career and professional life after you complete your education.\nIn addition, there is a larger element of this course that connects us to people from the past, present, and future. Namely, storytelling.\nAccording to communications theorist Walter Fischer, human beings are more than Homo sapiens, we are Homo narrans, man the storyteller. Storytelling is hardwired into our brains and our cultures and history. Stories are how we make sense of our life and our world. This is why religion, philosophy, literature, and myth have been vital to human culture and understanding. Even science is a story—it tells us how the world works. But it cannot tell us why. Only story-based meaning can reveal why life is important, how we should live our lives, and why there is something rather than nothing. Think of the Bible. If one were to take out the stories, it would be a thin book.\nDon’t let these ideas scare you. This is a creative course not a philosophic one. The point here is that as you increase your storytelling skills—a vital part of this course—you will join the community of narrators throughout human history who have shared their wisdom, insight, and understanding. This knowledge serves as the foundation for building identities, developing traditions, and discovering the types of meaning that make life worth living across all cultures.\nThis course will focus on one aspect of narratives, namely visual storytelling. How do we use pictures (and sounds) to create meaning and emotionally connect people to ourselves and each other? This will be the deeper theme operating beneath the surface of this course. (In film terms it will be the subtext beneath the text.)\nIn practical terms, the better you are at communicating stories (relative to each profession), the better you will be at your job. Fasten your seat belt, you are about to find out why we have focused on the above to start this course.",

    "text": "1.1 Course Introduction\nWe begin Unit 1 marvelling at the magic of film and cinema. (Read the course text Preface.) The ability of visually-centered storytelling to cross cultures and to captivate, educate, and entertain audiences is a universal contemporary phenomenon. For instance, how a series of flickering lights and images projected at 24, 25, and 30 frames a second can create emotions and experiences we all share is a wondrous mystery.\nLess mysterious is how this is done. There are techniques, rules, guidelines, and practices that can help us reach people in the ways that films, TV shows, streaming Internet programs, news, and the host of other visually-centered can make us laugh, cry, and emotionally move and engage us. The worst thing that can be said by an audience is that “I want my five, ten, sixty, or ninety minutes back (depending on the length of what we have viewed). Learning the methods to avoid this and to engage our audience will be central to this course.\nWHAT LIES AHEAD\nThis course will be divided up into ten segments or units. Each segment (or chapter) is self-contained but each section is inter-connected and vital for the others. A word to the wise—do note not skip a section, even if you think that you already know it. Each section of the course will build upon the previous one.\nSee the overview of the course and the ten units in the Introduction to the course text: Introduction to Digital Filmmaking: A Beginner’s Guide to Mastering the Craft.\nOf special note, Unit Ten and Chapter Ten will be a summary and a celebration of what you have learned during the course. It will also be a time for awards to be handed out for outstanding and excellent work such as Awards for Best film, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing., Best Story, and Most Imaginative and Most Improved Filmmaker, etc. This is noted here to give you a goal to work towards: namely, to win one of the top awards.\nAs can be gleaned from the above, this course will start with the most basic elements and proceed to creating a short film with a strong beginning, middle, and end. As you move through the course keep the mindset that this will be a fun, enjoyable, and exciting adventure.\n\n1.1.1 Activity: The Importance of the Film Journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nDuring this course you are encouraged to keep a “Film Journal.” This is important for many reasons, including helping you to brainstorm ideas, as well as ponder and process what you are learning. The journal will also help you to keep a record of your course activities, and note feedback of what does and does not work in film projects of your fellow course members. In addition, some of the exercises for this course will not be graded (for reasons that will be explained ahead) but this does not mean you will not be accountable for doing them. Your journal will be submitted at the end of the course and will play a role in the grade you receive. In short, students who engage with the course well will in general receive higher marks.\nAlso, note that you may be asked to use your journal entries to participate in discussions, presentations, and other learning activities in the FAR Centre Facilitated Learning Labs. Please check with your facilitator about specific due dates for activities, including journal responses.\nUnit 1 Film Journal Entry:\nBased on the importance of the course journal make your first two entries for this unit:\n\nEntry One: After reading the course text Introduction, describe your best take-aways of what you have learned.\nEntry Two:Study the recommended how-to-write-a-journal resources and log what you learned from them and how it will help you during the course.\n\nHow to Start a Creative Journal\nWatch: How to Journal Every Day for Increased Productivity, Clarity, and Mental Health \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Your journal entries do not have to be long but they should be detailed and specific enough to indicate that you have engaged the course material and projects.",

    "text": "1.2 Excellence and Professional and Personal Development\nThis course will focus on the classical approach to filmmaking, that is, making motivated film stories and executing them in ways that help audiences to fully engage the story and characters without unnecessary distractions. In doing so, the course has a lofty goal: to aim for excellence.\nExcellence means a high standard of being good. This is of course relative to being an Introductory course with students who are just beginning their filmmaking journey, or are taking this course as an elective. But like any course, if you shoot for an A you will do better than settling for average and mediocrity.\nExcellence is important in filmmaking because our competition is great. Film is a public medium. It is designed to be shown to audiences and the quality of our projects, like many things we do in life, will be judged whether we want them to be or not.\nOne of the transferable life skills of this course is to help us be more professional. Thus the more we shoot for excellence, the more we will develop abilities that will serve us better in our careers ahead.\nAt the same time we must not confuse excellence with perfection. Our beginning films and projects will have lots of mistakes and things that do not work. This should not deter us from our goal of excellence. All great artists, athletes, business leaders, and a host of other professional make mistakes. The key is to learn from them and to keep improving our craft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHELPFUL HINT: For insight into how great artists, athletes, and performers use mistakes to grow in their art and craft see the following book by Daniel Coyle: The Talent Code: Greatness Isn’T Born. It’S Grown. Here’S How.\n\n\n\nOur goal then is to learn how to seek to produce visually-driven, digital film stories that are technically and artistically proficient, meaningfully engaging, motivated, and fraught with excellence.\nAs you can see excellence and professionalism go hand in hand. In order to grow and excel in a craft we need to grow and excel at being professional. Implied here is that we also need to mature and grow personally as we develop the character traits necessary for being a mature, moral, and responsible person.\n\n1.2.1 Activity: Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nRead Chapter One “Project Excellence and Professionalism” in the course textbook.\nAs you study and ponder what excellence and what professional and personal development mean, log in your journal why they are important and how you hope to focus on them during the course. Which character traits are your strongest and which do you need to work on? How will you do this? To help you with these entries study this resource:\nHow To Grow Professionally",

    "text": "1.3 15 Tips for Doing Your Best\nThe following will help you to not just do well in this Film project, but will make it fun and more enjoyable and hopefully be one of your favourite courses ever:\n\nKeep your eye on the prize. Creating an excellent project and growing as a professional and better person through the process.\nMeeting Deadlines. Being on time is vital in any profession, especially in filmmaking where the cost of feature film shoots can be thousands of dollars per hour. Plan your time and schedule accordingly so that you make your due date. Failure to do so will result in reduced marks on your assignment.\nAvoiding Distractions. In our Internet-cell phone era we are inundated and surrounded by 24/7 distractions. If we succumb to them we will not meet our deadlines and thus delay our professional and personal development. Learning to discern what is vital and what is the tyranny of the unimportant and unnecessary urgent is a critical skill to develop today. Focus on it and you will go further in the course. (Tip: turn off all notifications on your cell phone. In fact, turn off or put your cell phone away while you are working on your Film course. You will find that this will help you to focus on and finish your assignments quicker and with more creativity).\nFocussing on the positive. Most of the assignments ahead will be challenging. Cultivate a “can do attitude.” For context think about your taking a piano lesson course. You would not expect to sit down and immediately play chords and songs. You would have to learn to play the notes, then chords, then songs over a period of time. Filmmaking is similar. There are notes to learn (film shots), chords to learn (film scenes), before we can create melodies (film sequences) and songs (full films).\nIt takes time and practice to master film. If you find you have time, or if you are truly interested in learning the world of film or becoming a filmmaker, I encourage you to go beyond the course exercises. For example, continue to find and shoot interesting visual compositions (they are all around you) during the course, or practice fascinating and more complicated motion shots and two and three person shots. The more you do this the faster you will grow in your craft. Think about musicians. They practice over and over everyday.\nStudy the practical tips and helpful hints in these units. Pay attention to them. They will help fast-track your skills growth.\nFind and do what you love. During this course you will discover things you love to do and those that you do not. As a filmmaker, every skill set is vital for the final production – but you will discover which roles you are better at and enjoy the most. Even if you do not go into filmmaking as a career this self-insight will be invaluable as you make life decisions ahead.\nMake a firm commitment to succeed. When we are double-minded or not sure of what we want, we will waiver and fall prey to distraction and self-sabotage. Resolve not to give up as you make your projects despite what “Murphy’s Law” tosses your way. (To be covered later.)\nStrive for balance. The emphasis on excellence and professional and personal development must not make us “lose our soul.” Too many people get caught up in goals and ambition and end up failing in their marriage and relationships. Remember we are physical, mental, spiritual, emotional, and relational beings and must find a balance that lets us grow in each part equally. This is the key to personal flourishing.\nCreate strong and healthy relationships. During this course you will discover a lot about yourself and others. Some people will be easy to work with and some won’t. Some will be diligent and some won’t. Choose your teammates wisely and if you have a winning rapport with them, you might want to work with them on the next project. One of the keys to success in the professional world is cultivating strong and fruitful relationships. Start the process here.\nFollow your intuition. If you’ve never experimented with following your deeper instincts or “gut feelings” try it during this course. Often this will take you to new creative places. It might not always work but you will learn a lot from doing so.\nTake risks. We don’t grow unless we try new things and fail. They key is not to get discouraged but to shake off a loss and fight to win again.\nPractice, practice, practice. Learn, learn, learn. Your best competition is continually practicing and learning their craft. So should you. You need to cultivate both a strong work ethic and a smart ethic. Take the time to think things through before launching into something.\nTake responsibility for yourself and your future. Playing the blame game or the victim or continually making excuses will not get you ahead in life.\nFind inspiring quotes and pin them to your computer or wall. Most of us need encouragement especially when the going gets tough. Seek out inspiration that helps keep you going. The following strike some of the themes of this course:\n\n\n\n“Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.” - Winston S. Churchill\n\n\n\n\n“It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.” - Herman Melville\n\n\n\n\n“You will become clever through your mistakes.” - German Proverb in “The Talent Code”\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Activity: Reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nWhich of the tips in this section appeal to you most? Which do you need to focus on during the course? Write your response in your journal and share with your facilitator and/or classmates which are most important and why. Find an inspiring quote and share it with your peers.",

    "text": "Overview\nFilmmaking is exciting. We get to create and challenge ourselves as we make projects that can wow and inspire people. It is also a challenging art and craft. Film as a medium incorporates many other arts such as acting (like theatre); sets and production design (like painting and architecture); rhythm and timing (like music); scripts (like literature); movement (like dance), plasticity of form (like sculpture); as well as its unique combination of these many other arts.\nGiven the many skills needed to make a great film over time, filmmakers have devised a system to make it easier for filmmakers. This process is so well honed that some filmmakers, like experimental filmmakers, can do it all: produce, direct, act, shoot, and edit their film. However, the larger the film production and the bigger the budget, the more complicated the process becomes and the more people need to do it.\nLike in a story that has a beginning, middle and end, the filmmaking process is divided into three sections or segments: pre-production, production, and post-production. (There is a fourth component dealing with marketing and distribution, but this will not be covered in this course.) We start with an overall look at the filmmaking process. This will give us the big picture of what will lie ahead so that we do not get lost in the details of the many elements of filmmaking, and so that we can place what we will be doing and practicing in a larger framework.",

    "text": "2.1 The Three Phases of Filmmaking\nIn Unit 1 we focused on project excellence and great storytelling and why they are important. This unit will help obtain these goals by breaking the filmmaking process down into three phases. Each phase depends upon the other and if we fail to understand and execute each one well, the other phases and the film itself will suffer.\nThe overall filmmaking process has not changed much over the past century. In short, it involves three phases: Pre-Production—preparing to shoot a project; Production—shooting or filming the project; Post-Production—editing or putting all of the production elements together in a unified final project.\nUnderstanding these three phases is vital to making a great film. You will not have to master each phase, no one can because there are too many elements and skills involved depending on the complexity of the film, its story, and its execution.\n\n2.1.1 Activity: Shooting a Film\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nTo get a visual representation of the overall filmmaking process view the following resource:\nWatch: Shooting a film - START to FINISH!\n\nDon’t worry if you do not know all of the terms he is using such as blocking, dolly, tilt up, etc. These terms will be covered in the units ahead.

    "text": "2.2 Pre-Production\nLike most things in life, if you do not have a strong foundation, what follows after will wobble. Proper pre-production is the foundation of an excellent film (and your up-coming exercises). The better you plan something, the better the result.\nThere are many elements to pre-production. When followed properly they enhance the 5 Cs of successful filmmaking (see the Why Pre-Production is Important section in Chapter 2 of the course text):\n\nCreativity\nCalmness\nCo-ordination\nCoherence\nConsistency\n\nProper pre-production involves many important general steps (see What Proper Pre-Production Entails section in Chapter 2 of the course text).\n\nPlanning\nAnticipation\nStrategizing\nTesting\n\nAs can be gleaned from above, pre-production helps ensure that a film project maximizes the creative process and minimizes chaos, confusion, and uncertainty—the enemies of a good film.\nThere are many steps in the prep-production process highlighted in Chapter 2. (See Successful Steps of Pre-Production.)\nThey involve:\n\nCreating a viable concept for a project\nKnowing who the audience is and genre requirements (people who like comedy want to laugh, people who like horror want to be scared)\nCreating a script to film\nCreating storyboards and shot lists\nPitching your project to get funding, actors, crew members, etc.\nBudgeting the cost of the film\nGetting your actors and the right crew\nFinding locations and props\nScheduling the shoot\nTesting your gear to make sure you know how to use it and that it works properly.\n\nAs can be seen, there is a lot involved before we film. Luckily, we will start with short exercises which will take minimal pre-production and gradually build to the more detailed aspects later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The lion’s share of this unit and Chapter Two in the course book is devoted to pre-production to emphasize how important this phase is. Most people might think production is the most important part of the filming process. In fact, each phase is. In Hollywood the development process (creating the screenplay) and pre-production for a film often takes far longer than production. Post-Production is also a longer process than production when a major film is involved.",

    "text": "2.3 Production\nThe production phase involves the shooting of the film, what is often referred to as “principle photography”. (Sometimes pick-up shots, re-dos, and B-roll footage are done during post-production.) For many filmmakers this is the most exciting part of filmmaking when they get a chance to go on location and watch actors do their magic.\nLike pre-production, the production phase must be attended to thoughtfully and diligently or you will not have what you need to edit your film and make your story work. This is why a large portion of this course and the course text are dedicated to this phase of filmmaking, which will only be covered briefly here.\nIn addition to filming the actors, locations, action sequences, etc. production also includes recording on-location audio for the project. Capturing, recording, and creating good sound, like cinematography, takes lots of time and practice.\nMost of the production process takes place on real locations such as streets, schoolyards, restaurants, etc., and sets which are built for the filming. If you have the budget, filming on sets such as kitchens, living, rooms, police stations, etc. is easier than real locations. The reason for this is that you can control the lighting and use of space better and will not have extraneous and disruptive noises occurring in the environment.\nProduction can also include green screen and CGI (computer generated imagery) work, but these are normally for bigger budget productions since they are specialized skills and it’s costly to do them well. They are also time consuming. (If you have After Effects and other special effects software skills please consider using them in this course.)\nPerformance is a crucial part of the filming process. Many filmmakers forget this and get so caught up in the shooting process that they overlook or miss bad acting. Don’t fall into this trap. You want to work on having your actors deliver believable, motivated, non-melodramatic performances. More on this later.",

    "text": "2.4 Post-Production\nThe final phase of the filmmaking process involves post-production where all elements of pre-production and production are “cut” or stitched together to create a finished film.\nLike production, the post process is hands-on and labor intensive. If done digitally, it involves using software such as Adobe Premier Pro, Apple Final Cut, Avid, DaVinici Resolve, etc. to edit the footage and make transitions such as fades, dissolves, wipes, etc. (to be covered later). This can be easy but a lot of work goes into choosing the best and rights shots and editing them together.\nThere are four phases to cutting the picture of a film:\n\nAssembly Cut: where the shots are placed together in proper order without trimming them.\nRough Cut: where you begin to “trim the fat” from the beginning and end of shots to get a feel for how the story will flow.\nFine Cuts: which will involve multiple versions as you trim or cut shots and scenes that do not work. You can further hone the film of any “excess” fat that does not add to the effective presentation of the story and characters.\nFinal Cut: which is the “locked” picture version that the composer and sound design people need to add music and sound effects to precise moments in the story.\n\nIn addition to cutting the picture, post-production also entails:\n\nSound Design where the right music and sound effects are chosen and added.\nTitling and Graphics when the opening and ending film credits appear and any special written material that will appear on the screen such as: FIVE YEARS EARLIER.\nTest Screening your film to those you trust to make sure the story works and is clear, and to test how an audience will respond.\nColor Correcting where the flow of the color and light and dark nature of the images appears seamless and appropriate. This is where you correct over exposed and under expose shots or those with the wrong color temperature. (Look these terms up in the film glossary you are using during this course. Refer to Activity 1.2 in Unit 1)\nAudio Mixing which involves finding the right levels and balance between the sound elements such as dialogue, music, sound effects, room tone, etc.\nFormat Delivery: What resolution will you use to export your film project? The wrong one can undermine the quality of your film.As can be gleaned, there is a lot to post-production but by carefully studying and practicing the units ahead it will make it easier.\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed and intimidated, you will not be alone. This is a lot to do and learn and this is why the bigger film projects can be done with team members.\n\n2.4.1 Activity: Reflect and Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nBased on this unit and your reading of Chapter 2 in the course text, share in your journal why knowing the overall process is important and what you learned most from this unit.\nShare also if you are feeling intimidated. Remember all but one of the graded assignments will be done in teams so you will not have to do it all alone.",

    "text": "3.1 Elements and Principles of Composition\nElements of Composition\nAt heart, visual composition means the intentional arrangement or conscious activity of constructing the “ingredients” of an image. As we grow in our filmmaking craft, we must continually be aware of what takes place within the frame (the border of a picture or a film shot). Focusing on a single image can help train us to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Tip: Before continuing below, study this overview of the building blocks of composition in art: The Visual Elements: The Building Blocks of Composition in Art\n\n\n\nThe following are some of the formal elements that make up the design and structure of an image. However, it is important to remember that subject matter and composition are linked and therefore do not get locked in to rigidly adhering to what you are learning. Many masters break the rules but they know them well before they do so.\n\nLine\nShape (geometric, organic, natural)\nColour (hues, intensities, symbolism)\nTexture (tactile feel)\nValue (shadows and shading)\nForm (3-D, 2-D)\nSpace (positive/objects); (negative/space between objects)\nDepth (foreground/mid-ground/background)\n\nPrinciples of Composition\nIn addition to elements of design, there are also principles or general rules that help give structure to visual compositions and which can also lend meaning or a theme to an image. Elements are specific things whereas principles are more general. Here are four that the course text focuses on:\n1. Balance\n2. Rule of Thirds\n3. Repetition and Patterns\n4. Combinations\nThere are many other principles such as the use of triangles and frame within a frame in compositions.\n\n3.1.1 Activity: Read and Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nRead and study Chapter 3. Be sure to study each of the images provided in this section and how the elements are used. This will increase your understanding of how they function in visual compositions. Before exploring the rest of this chapter, study this essay to help guide you during the process we are exploring: 11 Thoughts: An Introduction to Photographic Composition, by Todd Vorenkamp.\nQuestion to Consider\nBased on your study of this section, what are some observations you can share in your journal and with you facilitator and classmates?\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Activity: Readings on Techniques and Principles of Composition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nRead the article 28 Composition Techniques That Will Improve Your Photos, and Principles of Design.

    "text": "3.2 Photographic Themes\nThe subjects of a visual image includes the objects, people, or items in the frame. E.g., a mountainous landscape, a portrait of twins, etc.\nA more advanced approach to composition involves the use of creating a theme or deeper meaning to a composition, or where you take a topic such as clothes on clotheslines and photograph a series of images that reveal their beauty or what they say about the culture, people, or environment where they were shot.\nAs you grow in your composition skills you will discover how to add more depth, interest, and meaning to your photographs and images.\n\n3.2.1 Activity: Read and Explore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nYou do not have to create a theme for your photographs in this unit. However, studying websites like the following can help enrich your understanding and find images that stand out in intriguing, startling, fascinating, and emotionally moving ways.\n\nWalker Evans MoMA Exhibit\nThe outstanding Depression Era works of Dorothea Lange are also rich with theme. See The History Place Dorothea Lange\nTop 10 Most Famous Portrait Photographers In The World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful Hint: The photographs of Walker Evans and Dorethea Lange cited above are almost one-hundred years old. But they reveal the way their heartfelt themes and beauty are universal and timeless—the goal of excellent photos.\n\n\n\nLog in your journal and share with a peer in your course what you learned about photographic themes.",

We can have a simple subject with little composition. A white ball on a black table. Or we can have a complex composition with little subject matter. The bokeh (blurred or out of focus) of rain splashes on a glass window.\nWe have emphasized composition here because well composed shots are a foundational building block of a good film. As you will learn, if the head space of your shots is too much or too little, or there is a lack of balance of how people are arranged, or if you do not give enough leading entry space in a jogging shot, it will detract from the effect of your film.

We hope you found it exciting to go out and explore your world through a lens and design a creative still image.\nIn this Unit you begin your journey into the world of motion pictures. At heart, film (and video) is a temporal medium. It involves a series of images that unfold over time, most often at the rate of 24, 25, or 30 frames per second. This rate of frame-flow gives film its sense of moving pictures where a series of single frame images of a galloping horse look like the horse is actually running. This is why film is considered a kinetic medium where moving people and objects take center stage.\nWe began with still photos in the previous unit because they are easier to control and to frame. In this unit we are going to add motion to what we compositionally frame. This will bring a lot more variables to image creation and make it more exciting for many people. As you focus on motion you must not be tempted to forget the lessons learned in the previous unit.

However, film and video add new variables and techniques given that they deal with moving or motion pictures.\nHowever, as we explore film motion, we must remember that film and video involve a series of still images being projected and that persistence of vision makes them appear connected. (See the first Helpful Hint in the course text Chapter 4.) This is why we need to incorporate what we have learned about visual composition as we create our “moving” pictures.\nThe main types of motion shots include:\n\nZOOMS\nPAN SHOTS\nSWISH OR WHIP PAN\nTILT SHOTS\nDOLLY\nDOLLY ZOOMS\nTRACKING\nARCING\nFOLLOW SHOTS\nCRANE SHOTS\n360-DEGREE TRACKING SHOTS\nSLIDERS\nGOPRO\nDRONES\nSHAKY CAMERA\n\n\n4.1.1 Activity: Motion Shots Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nStudy Chapter 4 of course e-text: Digital Filmmaking: A Beginner’s Guide to Mastering the Craft.

    "text": "5.1 Basic Grammar of Film\nIn the previous units we look at the basic building blocks of visual composition and cinematic motion. In this unit we are going to learn how to put them together with a variety of other shots to make cinematic context and meaning. This is the grammar of film used to make cinematic “sentences” which convey meaning and context to an audience as we create scenes, sequences, and short films.\nHowever, as we focus on the components of filmmaking, we must not let the emphasis only be on film logic. We also want to cultivate the role that intuition and feeling play as we develop shots and put them together. This reminder is important because filmmaking is as much art as technical craft. We need to know the craft—the technical aspects—but also the art—the aesthetic and emotional dimensions. We need to keep this before us as we venture into the many elements and guidelines of effective filmmaking.\nIn this first topic you will learn about: - Frames - Shots - Scenes - Sequences - Acts\nThese components give you the big picture of how the many smaller elements add up to create mood and meaning in a film project.\n\n5.1.1 Activity: Read, and Explore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nFind and consult a film glossary such as Brooklyn College Film Glossary. Continue to read and study the one you like throughout this course and it will help you grow your film vocabulary and your understanding of the many components and processes involved in filmmaking. Set a goal to learn 5 new terms or concepts each day.",

So this will be a great opportunity to learn to give and receive feedback.\nBut fear not. Based on your previous work and what you will learn in this unit you will be ready to make a film that is “public” worthy.

    "text": "6.1 In-Camera Project and Its Benefits\nYour first film project will be something you might never do again if you go into the film and television world. You will shoot a short film with no dialogue in the exact sequential order that it will appear when you screen it for classs.\nAlmost always, films are shot out of sequence to save time and money by doing all the scenes in one location at a time and then all the scenes in another location at one time, etc.\nHere you will be forced to shoot at a location and move to the next, and if the first location is needed you will have to go back to it. Why do this? There are multiple benefits, as the course text chapter highlights. Some of them include:\n\nForcing you to think of a simple story that fits these parameters.\nChallenging you to plan your shots in a linear, well-thought out way.\nMaking you attentive to each shot and how relates to the previos ones.\nChallenging your brainstorming and film logic skills.\n\n\n6.1.1 Activity: Read, Study and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nRead and study Chapter 6. Write in your journal your initial thoughts regarding the benefits of doing an in-camera film. Does it thrill and excite you or make you apprehensive and anxious? Or maybe a combination of these feelings and emotions. As artists we need to get in touch with our feelings and learn to work with them not fear them.\nTo prime your imagination for the upcoming project, watch the video Watch: Visual Storytelling 101 \n\n\n\nSecrets to a Simple Story\nIn order to do this first project, you will need to come up with a story to film. Something has to happened to someone and they must engage in action to address it. But if we are to design a good story—one that holds the attention of our audience and engages them—we need to focus on several things in our short film project:\n\nOne or two main characters.\nA single problem or conflict.\nKnowing your genre (will your film be funny, dramatic, scary, etc.?).\nA simple setting or number of locations.\nA satisfying ending.\n\nYou need to keep this simple formula in mind in the projects ahead. There will be many forces and temptations that will distract you and pull you away from this simple understanding. Resist them and go back to basics if you get lost, confused, or frustrated.",

    "section": "6.2 Brainstorming and Successful Creativity",
    "text": "6.2 Brainstorming and Successful Creativity\nThe secret to a story sounds simple and it is. We need to create a character with a goal and stakes (the painful consequences that will happen to the character) who has to overcome opposition to that goal and an ending that reveal whether or not the character obtains the goal.\nHowever, the challenge for most of us is, what story do I tell?\nBrainstorming is a great tool and way to discover and find the right story you want to tell. Brainstorming involves the spontaneous development of ideas. Brainstorming can be done alone or within a group.\nThe great thing about brainstorming is that you do not have to judge and criticize the process and results. In addition, you are not trying to perfect. You are only looking for that one idea that sparks your creativity and you ignore the others. This non-judgmentalism and jettisoning of perfectionism is important because these two tendencies stifle creativity.\nEven if you already have a story idea that you want to film you are strongly encouraged to engage in brainstorming activities during this section and the rest of the course. If you do, you unleash more of your creativity and you will most likely find a better story concept.\n\n6.2.1 Activity: Brainstorming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nAfter you feel you have a good grasp of brainstorming, engage in the process and come up with 5 story concepts that fit the criteria in the previous topic:\n\nOne or two main characters.\nA single problem or conflict.\nKnowing your genre (will your film be funny, dramatic, scary, etc.?).\nA simple setting or number of locations.\nA satisfying ending. After you have done this go through your concept list and choose your top one and apply it to the template in the next topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful Hint: If you find yourself stuck and can’t come up with a story concept, tell your facilitator and have a group brainstorming session. Take one of the ideas and develop it. Share your concept if you are stuck finding one of the criteria such as a goal or stakes and ask for brainstorming help to solve the problem. Remember, film is mostly a collaborative venture.\n\n\n\n\n\nShort Film Story Template\nOnce you have your core story concept you now need to make it into a full story with a beginning, middle, and end. We also need to make sure we do not make it too complicated or muddled.\nMany of us have the tendency to overly complicate things: to add extraneous detail or to have elements that are not clear well explained. The template is this section is designed to prevent these issues as you use a fairy tale structure to find your characters, the problem they are facing, and show what happens in a clear way with a beginning, middle, and end of the story.\nHave fun with this template process. Also do not forget to use brainstorming for each section of the template so that you come up with the best characters, situations, locations, and conflict which are not predicable or have a “been there, done that” (boring) quality.\n\n\n6.2.2 Activity: Planning Your Film\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nOnce you have brainstormed and have a clear and solid concept film, e.g., a student who has the power to turn things in gold, use the Fairy Tale Template for a Short Film and write your story for your short film by filling in the blanks.\nStudy the illustration example given in the chapter and then apply the process to the creation of your film story. In crafting your story you are not allowed to use dialogue beyond “yes,” “no,” and “okay.” That is, you must find visual ways to establish your story’s setup and context and its build and payoff. For example, you cannot have your character say “I am on my way to the store.” You will just show him or her getting in the car, driving, arriving at the store parking lot, and entering the store.

Digital video editing software is helpful because it allows you to edit your images and sync them to the rhythm and beats of your sound track and export your project for viewing or streaming on the Internet.\nThere are many types and brands of editing software in the marketplace and you will have to choose the one that works for you. Some applications only work with Android-based cellphones and others for Apple ISO devices and some for both platforms such as imovie. If you want to really get series about editing you should explore Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere, Avid, DaVinci Resolve, or some other professional program.\nThere are similarities among editing software and programs but you will have to do a tutorial on YouTube or the manufacture’s website of the one you will use to see how to work it. The more popular the software, the more tutorials will be available.\n\n7.5.1 Activity: Read, Study, and Explore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nRead and study Chapter 7, Digital Editing Software section. Next, Find the digital video editing program you want to use and learn how to do basic editing with it.

    "text": "7.6 Montage Project\nCreating Your Montage\nAs we have seen, there are three main phases of film production and they will apply here:\n\nMontage Pre-Production\nMontage Production\nMontage Post-Production\n\nThe lion’s share of the emphasis in the chapter has been on post-production, but this does not mean you must take your pre-production and production work lightly. Your montage will only be as good as the images you have for it.\nThe following criteria can help us better evaluate our own work and that of others and to give constructive criticism on how to improve:\n\nOverall did the montage work?\nDid the music and/or sound effects work well with the images?\nDid the montage convey a mood, emotion, a story and/or theme (some insight into life)? If so, what was it?\nWere the shots well composed, motivated, and appropriately smooth or in some cases jarring depending on what is being communicated?\nWere the cuts timed well? If not, where did they not work well?\nWere the transitions appropriate and effective?\nWas the action followed well?\nWas there a sufficient variety of shots?\nWere some shots or images too repetitive?\nWere the shots and images interesting and noteworthy?\nWhat did you like best about the project?\nWhat suggestions would you offer to make it better?\n\n\n7.6.1 Activity: Read and Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nStudy the next section of Chapter 7 on creating a montage. As you study montage pre-production, production, and post-production make notes on your shooting script of what to watch out for and not forget as you film the shots and images you will use.\n\n\n\n\n7.6.2 Activity: Creating a Montage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nOnce you have edited your project and exported it, you are ready to show it to your classmates and instructor. This should be an exciting time as you screen the fruits of your labor and creativity! As previously mentioned, film is a public medium and subject to critique and evaluation.\nEvaluate and critique the work of your peers helping them to see what worked and did not work in their montage and why. When possible give suggestions of how something could have been done better. Remember the tone and substance of our critiques should be one that offers encouraging constructive insight and that helps each other to grow and improve their craft.\nFor insight into how to critique a short film watch the video Watch: Critiquing Your Short Films \n\n\n\n\n\n7.6.3 Activity: Self-Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nWrite in your journal what you learned about your project and yourself from the montage projects.\nUse the following questions to guide you:\n\nWhat was the best lesson I learned?\nWhat did I do well? Why?\nWhat did not work out as well as I planned? Why?\nWhat can I do better next time?\nWhat was the quality of my experience working with a partner?\nIf I did not work with a partner, could the project have been better if I had one?\nHow did this experience help me grow as a person and as a professional?\nWhat did I learn new about myself?\n\nBe sure to note which films and filmmakers had the best cinematography, editing, story, creativity, etc. so that you can consult this when you vote on the awards at the end of the course.",

    "text": "Overview\nMore kudos to you. You now have two film projects and a lot of film exercises in your experience bank account. You will now be moving up a level where you will have the opportunity to bring together all of what you have learned so far into a longer narrative film.\nIn the previous units you focused on how to make shorter films. In this unit and the next you will focus on creating longer forms where your film will be five to ten minutes in length. This might not seem long but the longer the film, the more you have to do to sustain interest and continually engage the audience. Mini-films (2-minutes and under) have less of this burden because an audience is not feeling like they are wasting a bigger chunk of their time if the film is not well done.\nNarrative films, whether fiction or non-fiction, are popular because they tell stories. Even if you do not want to be a “Hollywood” filmmaker learning to tell film stories will aid you in your personal and professional development. Human beings are hard-wired for storytelling. It is a primary way we make sense of the world and pass our knowledge and cultural values and traditions to others. Those who control the narratives of a society have powerful influence and impact.\nBefore moving ahead, view this resource:\nWatch: 7 Things to Know About Making Short Films! : FRIDAY 101",

    "text": "8.1 Types of Film and Genres\nTypes of Film \nThere are three main types of short films that we can do for the project ahead:\n\nClassical Narrative\nDocumentary\nExperimental, Avant-Garde, and Surreal Cinema\n\nMost of you will probably choose the classical narrative, but you are free to do the other two with the caveat that experimental/avant-garde films are far more challenging than they might appear.\nAs a transferable skill, like in many industries and businesses, smart filmmakers look for a market before they commit too much time and money to a film project. Others of course rely on their intuition and passion. Either way, it is wise to see what those who distribute or stream and screen short films, such as festivals and competitions, look for in making their choices. Their criteria can you vet the quality of your story and its execution. See Film Shortage’s What Type Of Short Films Do We Prefer?\nFilm Genres\nThe main films genres include:\n\nDrama\nComedy\nRomance\nAction\nThriller\nHorror\nGangster\nCrime\nAdventure\nWesterns\nSci-Fi\nFantasy\nHistorical\nEpic\nWar\nBio Pics (biographies)\n\nKnowing your film genre is important because it embodies narrative patterns and expectations audiences have, and if these are not fulfilled you will lessen your impact on those watching your film. Put another way, comedies need to be funny, horror films need to induce fear, romantic films need to inspire us to love, etc. Commercially, if these basic requirements are not met it can result in financial disaster and loss of reputation. At your level it will mean your film is not as effective as it could be.\nKnowing your genre will also help you develop your story and script in this and the following unit.\n\n8.1.1 Activity: Planning your Final Film Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nLog in your journal what type of film you want to work on for your final film project and why.\nNext, view this list of loglines (short one line descriptions of a film story) in various genres: Popular Short film genres Which genre appeals to you most? Why? Log this reflection and start to brainstorm genre-based story concepts.",

    "text": "8.2 Logistics for the Final Film Project\nThis last film is a major project and will account for a lot of your grade given that it will reveal what you learned during this course. In light of this, you will need to create a strong story and the “blueprint” or script for filming it.\nTo save time so that you can put more of your energy into making the film, you will not have to develop a full screenplay (hence the scriptment section below) for the final project, but you are strongly encouraged to do so.\nHowever, this does not mean you do not have to pitch a core story concept (a basic story, its genre, and hook or unique angle) to the class. Everyone will be required to do this so that you can gain more experience with your creativity and your pitching skills.\nOnce you have created a story concept that inspires you, pitch it to the class to see if other classmates want to join you in your project and to get feedback on it. Once you have your team in place you will then follow the process for creating a shooting script for pre-production and production.\n\n8.2.1 Activity: Story Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nIn the next activity, you’ll be asked to brainstorm and develop a core story idea to pitch to the class.\nTo help you do this, follow the steps in Story Research Section of Chapter Eight and ask and answer the questions in the What to Look for Section. This should prime your creative pump for the next topic. Also view this helpful resource:\nWatch: How to Write a Short Film \n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Activity: Brainstorm and Prepare Your Pitch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nBrainstorm either alone or with a partner and come up with a story concept to pitch to the class. The goal of this activity is to do find a compelling story and to pitch it in a way that will attract the teammates you will need to make your longer film.\nCheck the Guidelines for Pitching a Film Project\nTo prepare for your pitch make sure you:\n\nKnow your genre. The story above could be a comedy, a drama, thriller, or a horror film. Which genre you decide will determine the following.\nEstablish your main characters.\nEstablish the main conflict.\nEscalate the conflict.\nCreate some of the obstacles that will have to be overcome.\nHave a clear beginning, middle, and end.\nKnow what crew members you will need and what they will do, e.g., a screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, editor, etc.\n\nMake sure the story is compressed, a la Aristotle’s Poetics, with a limited number of characters, locations, and action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful Hints:\n\nSometimes a title for your film can lend lots of inspiration. Professional screenwriters and Hollywood spend a lot of time finding the right title that captures the spirit of the film and can aid in marketing. Think Rebel Without A Cause, Slum Dog Millionaire, Vertigo, Dumb and Dumber, The Haunting, Groundhog Day, When Harry Met Sally.\nMost of the short films that won or were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film follow Aristotle’s idea of great drama and comedy: a few characters and locations and action that takes place over a brief amount of time.",

The following steps will help you prepare a shooting script that will make pre-production, production, and post-production flow better.\n\nCreate a step outline.\nCreate a scriptment.\n\nYour scriptment should be written in a way that someone who reads it should be able to visualize and hear your film.\n\n8.3.1 Activity: Creating a Scriptment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nFor an overview of scriptments, consult this resource: Outlines, Treatments, and Scriptments, Oh My! by Ken Miyamoto.\nAs you do other drafts (good writing involves a lot of re-writing) to improve your story and polish your script so that everything is clear, it is helpful to ask the following questions. (These questions are designed for a fiction narrative film, though some of them can help vet your documentary or experimental film.) You might not have answers to all of them but you should for most of them. Again the emphasis in on helping you to be clear about your project.\n\nDo I have the right genre?\nDo I have a hook or is there something unique and fascinating about my story? It’s special angle.\nIs the story clear? A solid beginng, middle, and end?\nDo I focus on only a few characters and limited locations?\nAre my action and conflict unified and focused?\nDoes my main character have a goal?\nIs there an antagonist who or which wants to thwart that goal? (Remember, weather or a dog can be an antagonist.)\nAre their stakes or consequences for not obtaining the goal?\nAre there interesting obstacles to obtaining the goal?\nDo I have a set-up of the main character, problem, goal, and antagonist?\nDo I have some unexpected and unpredictable twists and turns in the middle section of my story?\nIs there a main conflict or battle that determines whether the main character gets his or her goal?\nDo I have a satisfying ending? (Remember not all endings have to be happy or closed. Open-ended endings are not resolved and make the audience guess, debate, and discuss what happened or might happen after).\n\nOnce you have your team and have developed the scriptment for your story, you can begin pre-production to get everything in place to film your project: e.g., cast, locations, props, gear, shooting schedule, etc.",

This is where higher-level creativity takes place.\nFilmmaking is like a language where you use the elements of grammar to make sentences. In this case, your shots to make scenes and the meaning the scenes will covey. The cumulation of sentences lead to paragraphs – the film equivalent of sequences, and the cumulation of paragraphs leads to sections (acts in film) and the cumulation of sections leads to your essay (in this case, your final film). You get the metaphor.\n\n9.1.1 Activity: Read, Watch and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nRead and study the first section of Chapter 9: The Syntax of Film.

Coverage is thus the shot material an editor or post-production team will use to assemble the scenes and sequences of a movie. Having proper coverage is critical if a scene and a film is to make sense.\nThe are many questions that can guide you as you break down your film script to determine what coverage to use and how to shoot a scene. (Remember a scene can be one shot such as driving to the store, or a series of shots such as someone confronting a person to get information from him or her.) Take the time to study the Questions for Discovering Coverage section.\nCoverage can be done well or poorly. Our goal is the former.\nThere are two main types of general coverage: Master Shots and Mini-Masters. Knowing why these are important and when to use them will help guide you to the more detailed coverage and shots you will employ as as you develop the action of a scene.\nFilmmaking is not a “paint by numbers” art. If you follow formulas, most likely your film will be predicable and lack freshness. This is why understanding shot progression is important. Choosing the types of shots you will use and their order will form a large part of your visual creativity in your film.\n\n9.2.1 Activity: Read and Watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Activity\n\n\n\nStudy the next section of Chapter 9 “The Importance and Types of Camera Coverage”. Next, watch the video Watch: What Is A Master Shot? \n\nQuestions to Consider\n\nExplain the value of why this type of shot can be beneficial as the first shot you do when you start your coverage of a scene? What is the downside of relying too much on a master shot?",

Storyboarding and storyboards can help simplify the process and make it easier to visualize what you want to do and how to do it.\nIt will help your scene coverage if you storyboard your shots. They do not have to be elaborate. They can be simple stick figures such as this one that shows a long shot of someone pushing or struggling against something (the context of your story will determine this).\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: graphic stick figure pushing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe important thing is not the quality but that your storyboards make sense to you and your crew so you will know how to approach a shot and why.\nAt the same time, do not become a slave to your storyboard. If you discover something better or get inspired on the film set, try the new thing. For safety, shoot it the storyboard way and then the new way and decide during post-production which one will work best.",

You can do this alone but it will be better if at least the director and cinematographer for your project work on this together. Ideally everyone on the team should work on this so that you will bond and have a unified vision of how to stage and shoot your shots.\nWatch the video Watch: Master the Art of Shot Lists: Boost Your Filmmaking Efficiency! \n\n\n\nMake sure to include your shot lists in your final project and course journal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful Hint: Remember your locations will determine a lot of how you can and cannot shoot a scene. A drone will not work in a small room. Therefore, be sure to scout your locations and take pictures of them as you desing your storyboards and shot lists. Be sure to also confirm that the locations will be available for your shooting schedule.",
