# Topic 5: Direction Vectors and Eyeline Requirements

Now that you have your story and one-line action descriptions, and have your actors, props, and locations set-up, you are ready to film your story (the In-Camera film project) with your cell phone.

Before doing so, this exercise will require that you focus on several things found in the Direction Vectors and Eyeline Requirements section:

  - Proper Lead Room
  - Motivated Shot Movement
  - Consistent Screen Direction
  - Proper Eye-Line Vectors
  - Proper Headroom

These requirements should not worry you since you have explored and tried many of these techniques in the composition and film movements units.
