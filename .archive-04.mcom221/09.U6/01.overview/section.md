# Unit 6: Visual Storytelling

## Overview

Congratulations. You are now ready to make a rare type of film. Rare you say? Yes, because you are going to shoot your film project in a way that is not done very often, that is, in full sequential order. What this means will be explained ahead.

We are now at a point in the course where you are going to be held accountable for your work. The earlier exercises were not graded to give you the chance to explore and make mistakes, without regard to a grade. We now have to cross into that territory. The main reason for this is that, as mentioned previously, film is a public medium and your work will be critiqued when it is shown. So this will be a great opportunity to learn to give and receive feedback.

But fear not. Based on your previous work and what you will learn in this unit you will be ready to make a film that is “public” worthy. In addition, this first film will only account for 10% of your grade so you are encouraged to explore and take risks.

## Topics

This unit is divided into the following topics:
1. The In-Camera Project and Its Benefits
1. Secrets to a Simple Story
1. Brainstorming and Successful Creativity
1. Short Story Film Template
1. Direction Vectors and Eye-line Requirements
