## Topic 2: Secrets to a Simple Story

In order to do this first project, you will need to come up with a story to film. Something has to happened to someone and they must engage in action to address it. But if we are to design a good story—one that holds the attention of our audience and engages them—we need to focus on several things in our short film project:

  - One or two main characters.
  - A single problem or conflict.
  - Knowing your genre (will your film be funny, dramatic, scary, etc.?).
  - A simple setting or number of locations.
  - A satisfying ending.

You need to keep this simple formula in mind in the projects ahead. There will be many forces and temptations that will distract you and pull you away from this simple understanding. Resist them and go back to basics if you get lost, confused, or frustrated.
