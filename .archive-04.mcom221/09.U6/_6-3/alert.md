After you feel you have a good grasp of brainstorming, engage in the process and come up with <span class="underline">20 story concepts</span> that fit the criteria in the previous topic:

  - One or two main characters.
  - A single problem or conflict.
  - Knowing your genre (will your film be funny, dramatic, scary, etc.?).
  - A simple setting or number of locations.
  - A satisfying ending.
After you have done this go through your concept list and choose your top one and apply it to the template in the next topic.

**Helpful Hint**: If you find yourself stuck and canâ€™t come up with a story concept, tell your facilitator and have a group brainstorming session. Take one of the ideas and develop it. Share your concept if you are stuck finding one of the criteria such as a goal or stakes ask for brainstorming help to solve the problem. Remember, film is mostly a collaborative venture.
