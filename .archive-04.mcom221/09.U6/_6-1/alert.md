#### Activity 6.1: Read, Reflect and View

Read the first section of Chapter 6 about the benfits of doing an in-camera film. Write in your journal your initial thoughts regarding this assignment. Does it thrill and excite you or make you apprehensive and anxious? Or maybe a combination of these feelings and emotions. As artists we need to get in touch with our feelings and learn to work with them not fear them.

Share with your classmates your responses. This can help foster tighter bonds among you as you realize you are not alone in your feelings or need of support.
