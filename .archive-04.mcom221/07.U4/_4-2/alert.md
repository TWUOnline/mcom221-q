#### Activity 4.2: Motion Shots Practice

:fa-book: Study the definitions of the main types of motion shots and how to do them. Then practice doing as many of them as you can. (Obviously you cannot do a GoPro or drone shot without that specific equipment, but you might be imaginative and find an alternative to do a similar type of shot.)

:fa-book: Write in your journal your observations about each type of shot and what you learned from doing them. Share these insights and questions with your class mates when you meet.

:fa-film: Before moving on to the next topic, view the following resources to augment your understanding of camera movement

*Note that this learning activity is ungraded, but is designed to help you succeed in your assessments in this course.*

*In addition, do not try doing zoom shots with your cell camera unless you have a special app that makes it smooth.  Squeezing your finger in and out to move closer or further away from your subject will result in a shaky shot.  Our goal is to disguise movement, not to draw attention to it.*
