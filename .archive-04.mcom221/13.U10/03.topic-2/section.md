## Topic 2: Film Festivals

Film festivals are great venues for building your reputation and advancing your career.

If your film merits it, your instructor will recommend that your film be adjudicated for entry into Cinergy, the annual TWU campus student film festival held each spring.

It will help you grow as a filmmaker if you research festivals and submit your work to them.
