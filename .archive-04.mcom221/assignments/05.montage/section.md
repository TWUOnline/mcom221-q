### Guidelines for Montage Assignment

**Assignment Goal**: The goal of your next assignment will be to explore how to
make an effective montage-based film that uses picture and sound to convey
meaning, emotion, and/or mood.

Criteria for Montage Exercise

1.  Create a 2.5 to 4 min. short film that relies on editing, sound (music Sound
    FX, etc.) and motivated camera work.

2.  Your project must include a montage, a series of images linked together to
    create or convey a mood, emotion, story, ideas, insight, etc. Montage can
    show passage of time, a flashback or a compilation of images for a mood or
    idea. As in the examples shown in class.

3.  You can do this project individually or work with a team member as long as
    the work is equally shared among the producing, directing, shooting,
    editing, etc. Ideally, you will work in terms of teams of two.

4.  Your project can be a music video; “visualizing” a poem or other text;
    physicalizing an inner monologue, e.g., using a Voice Over with amplified
    images to convey its meaning; or a mini-movie that fits a genre such as a
    romantic film or an action, thriller, horror, comedy, etc. (Use you can use
    the story template handed out in class or develop your own.

5.  More specifically, the goal is for you to plan and discover audio/visual
    correlations for the story, text, concept, issue, or idea you will explore
    and to focus on fluidity of motion and following the motion and smooth
    continuity and transitions as you use a series or flow of images to convey
    your story, mood, etc.

6.  Be sure to focus the appropriate rhythm of shots and their variety and
    transitions that fit the story, music, genre, etc.

7.  You are free to experiment with light, camera angles, composition, the
    manipulation of time and space, visual thematics, etc. Your finished piece
    will be edited using matching and counter-punctual sound and image
    techniques.

8.  You can chose a film style as covered in class as you find appropriate
    locations, props, activities, symbols, and justify and motivate the way you
    use the cinematography, *mise-en-scene*, and editing style to enhance their
    possibilities.

9.  Make sure the cuts and transitions are appropriate to the theme, drama,
    mood, etc.

10. As in the previous exercises make sure you use linear smooth, motivated,
    classic continuity, cutting, and camera work and ncorporate a variety of
    shot sizes, angles, motion, etc.

11. Submit a write-up detailing your concept/story, what you sought to do, your
    role(s) on project, and what you learned from the experience. Be sure to
