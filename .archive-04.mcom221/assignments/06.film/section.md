## Assignment 3: Final Film Project (40%)
*Due end of Unit 9*

### Guidelines for Pitching and Making the Short Film Project

**Purpose of the Project**: To come up with a good concept, write the story,
gather a dedicated team to make it into a film, and shoot and edit a short film
that brings together all of the elements of the course. Strive for project
excellence. If merited, your film will screen at Cinergy—our annual student film
showcase.

**Steps to Making a Good Short Film**

1.  Brainstorm and develop a good concept and story as per the elements stressed
    in the course. The Mackendrick Fairy Tale template can help again. For
    further inspiration look up mico and flash stories, e.g.,
    <https://bookriot.com/2018/06/18/flash-fiction-stories/>

2.  Keep the film simple—Aristotle’s POETICS—the unities of time, space, and
    character: a simple story (action) taking place over a limited amount of
    time and locations and told through a few characters.

3.  You can write an original story, adapt a myth, folktale, or Bible story,
    parable, fable, etc. as the basis for your project. Your approach can be
    “classical” or “experimental.”

4.  The goal then is for you and/or your team to write/adapt a short script,
    storyboard it, devise a shot list, and produce, shoot, and edit your
    project. Each team member must play a key role in the film, e.g., writer,
    director, cinematographer, editor, etc.

5.  As with your montage, present a good pitch (credibility, concept, hook,
    story, etc.) to attract the right people to your project. Your project pitch
    is due this Wednesday, 27 March.

6.  Your grade for this production will be based upon how well you have
    implemented and integrated the key concepts and insights covered in class
    and gained competency in the technical and aesthetical aspects of
    filmmaking. This project should be approximately 3 to 5 min. in length.

7.  Know your genre and style.

8.  Strive for an interesting and unique angle/hook and/or surprising twist at
    the end of the story. Avoid the mediocre. Watch a lot of short films on
    Vimeo.

9.  Write your script.

10. Storyboard it.

11. Cast your film wisely. Get good actors and good team members.

12. Don’t let actors mug or over act. Less is more.

13. Scout good locations—appropriate and interesting visuals.

14. Find interesting props.

15. Don’t dilly-dally. Procrastination increases the likelihood of Murphy’s Law.

16. Workout a plan—who will do what, a production schedule, and editing plan.

17. Bring in “rushes” and rough cuts to class for critique.

18. Gratitude—give an end credit to those who helped make the film, e.g., those
    who provided locations, props, music, etc. The music and permission to use
    it in your credits.

19. One member from each team must submit the project’s script, shot list, and
    storyboard and a list of who was on the team and what they did, e.g.,
    Producer, editor, script writer, etc.

20. Everyone must submit a write-up detailing what you did on the project, how
    much time was put in, your objective and intent, and what was learned from
    the experience. Please label your files with your name, final film write-up,
    course name and section (you will lose points if you do not do this) and
    send it to: <ned.vankevich@twu.ca> before the start of the class when the
    project is due. You must label your file accordingly Your Name MCOM 221
    Short Film Project Write-Up. Failure to do so will result in a loss of
    marks.

22. Please proof you work. I will stop correcting grammar, spelling, syntax,
    confusing sentences, etc. after five mistakes and you will lose 10% of your
    grade if I find more after this initial five.
