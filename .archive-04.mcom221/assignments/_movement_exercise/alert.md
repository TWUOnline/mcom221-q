## Motivated Camera Movement Exercise
*(ungraded, but part of journal entry)*

For this exercise on motion, you will shoot **5 different types** of motivated
kinetic shots, e.g., a pan, tilt, zoom, following action shot, etc. that have
smooth motion from the beginning to the end of the shot and “disguise” the
camera technique by matching the rate of camera move and subject movement.  

In our quest to learn the art of excellent filmmaking we will focus on creating
motivated motion shots. In doing this we can use shots that are context-centered
or context-free.  

For example, a context-centered shot would use a pan shot to show the comradery
or bond between a group of friends as they share and pass homemade cookies to
each other. The motion of the pan shot would match the rate of the characters’
movement as they take a cookie and pass the plate to the next friend.

A context-free shot would be to do a pan shot of a car as you practice following
the motion with enough lead space as you keep the car in the same part of the
frame as it passes. In other words, you will do a shot that follows motion for
the sake of practicing how to do it.

Don’t get too caught up in context-centered or context free shots. Just focus on
mastering camera movement and motivating it such as using a follow zoom where
you match the rate of the camera move and the subject movement so that we are
not away of the zoom in or the zoom out as you follow the action. For example,
you would start with a wide shot of someone entering a room and as he crosses
the room the use the zoom to move in closer and end with a waist to the top of
the head shot as the person is seated. Notice that this example would also
include a motivated tilt down as the person sits. This is a great type of shot
to practice to gain confidence in your motion shot skills.

The above examples might seem simple but they will take practice to execute
smoothly and not have any distracting bumps or mars in the smoothness of the
motion or not having characters bump their heads on the top of the frame as they
move or bump up against the edge of the frame.

When you can control the action (unlike following an airplane across the sky) be
sure to have a clean start and clear end to your shot. A clean start means
rather than launching immediately into the shot and action you take a beat or
short moment before stating the movement. A clear end means you hold the last
shot for at least a second before the person leaves the frame and you turn off
the camera. You will discover later that is important to have a clean open and
clear end when editing shots together.

Be sure to rehearse the shots and to do multiple takes. Only bring your best
example of each shot type to class. The more you practice the better you will
get.

! **Helpful Reminder**: Do not forget to create well composed shots. Review the principles of good composition and design from the last unit.

The following guidelines sheet will explain the specific requirements and
logistics for this assignment.

### Criteria for Assessing the Motion Shots

This exercise, like the previous one, will not be graded. You are learning the
basics and it is not fair to penalize you at this early stage. However, as we
are learning, film is a public medium and you will be showing your work to your
peers so in some ways you will be accountable for the quality of your shots. In
addition, if you do not practice these basics it will impact your grade in the
next assignments if you do not execute the techniques well.

The following questions will be discussed as you show your work:

-   Was the shot motivated?
-   Was the shot smooth or distracting?
-   Did it follow the action well?
-   Did the shot have a clean start and a clear end?
-   Was the shot well-composed in general?
-   Was the shot well-composed throughout from the beginning to the end?
-   What was interesting about the shot?
-   Was there anything that pulled us of being involved with the shot?
-   Did the shot combine more than one movement type? If so, how many and did
    they work well together? E.g., a zoom, pan, and tilt.

You will be wise to keep in mind the following as you design and practice your
shots:

-   Your goal is to create smooth, seamless, cinematic camera motion and learn
    how to motivate and disguise it by having the camera move at the apparent
    rate of the moving subject.
-   A Zoom should follow the movement and not go in and out during the move.
-   A Pan should move at the apparent rate of the subject and not lead or follow
    it.
-   Head room is important—be careful of bumping heads against the top of the
    frame during the shot or cutting parts of the head that look weird or
    inappropriate.
-   Lead room—have space for the subject to move into without bumping into the
    frame or feeling too squeezed…unless motivated by the situation or context.
    E.g., someone being pressured.
-   A Tilt should reveal something new and can be motivated by character
    movement, e.g. tilting down at the rate which the characters sits down or
    tilting up at the rate that someone picks something up.
-   A Dolly shot should follow the action (side to side) or be led by the
    subject. E.g., dolly back while doing a walk and talk.
-   Depth (S and arcing curves are normally more aesthetically pleasing)
-   Tracking/Trucking (lateral/parallel movement) at the apparent rate of the
    subject, i.e., not faster or slower than the subject movement which draws
    attention to itself.
-   Arc (combo pan and track—curved movement) can be motivated by a character’s
    move or situation.
-   Car/Helicopter/Camera Truck, etc. where we follow the subject at a smooth,
    non-attention grabbing rate.
-   Crane
-   Boom up/ Boom Down as a subject moves away.
-   Selfie stick
-   Drones
-   Follow the subject at the appropriate rate.
-   Gimbal shots
-   Follow the subject at the appropriate rate.

For this exercise we will avoid the shaky camera and fast-moving hand-held
techniques for obvious reasons.

! **Helpful Hint**: Before doing the following assignment read this resource for inspiration: “[Game Changers: Camera Movement](https://www.filmcomment.com/article/game-changers-camera-movement/),” and [8 Cinematic Camera Moves For Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_p93J3OwfU).

### Guidelines for Cinematic Motion Exercise

-   Your goal: to continue practicing basic filmmaking skills by exploring and
    experimenting with cinematic motion.

-   Before doing the exercise below go back to the previous unit and refresh
    your understanding of excellent visual composition.

-   You must shoot **5 different types** of motivated kinetic shots, e.g., a
    pan, tilt, zoom, following action shot, etc. that have smooth motion from
    the beginning to the end of the shot and “disguise” the camera technique by
    matching the rate of camera move and subject movement.

-   Your shots can be context-centered (reveal a character or story element) or
    context-free (merely follow action and show smooth camera work and motion).

-   You must have a clean start and a clear end of the shot as discussed during
    the course.

-   Given the parameters of this exercise *you will not be allowed to use a
    shaky handheld camera effect or technique*. Later, when properly motivated
    you can, but not for this exercise.

-   We will go into cameras later but for now keep this assignment simple and
    you can use your cell phone or, if you have one, a DSLR for this assignment.
    You can consult tutorials on YouTube, UDEMY, or other learning websites for
    how to shoot video you specific phone or camera.

-   You are strongly encouraged to use a tripod, selfie stick, gimbal, monopod
    or other similar devices to help you make smooth camera moves.

-   Be sure to rehearse and to do multiple takes until you are satisfied that
    you have a smooth, motivated shot. Only submit your best example of each
    type of shot.

-   Place your shots in the Course Folder with your name on it. The upload site
    address will be handed out in class.

-   Label the image with the type of moving shot that you did so that we are
    clear what you intended and whether it worked or not.

-   As with the composition exercise do not take this assignment lightly. You
    will learn important things from it. Remember the goal is to disguise the
    movement of the camera by subject movement and matching the flow rate of
    each so that you technique follows the action in a non-distracted, seamless
    or disguised and “invisible” manner.

-   Do not get coaching or help for this exercise. Do it on your own. You will
    learn more from your personal successes and failures.

-   The due date for this activity will be given out during the course.

-   Those wanting to excel at this exercise will do some research on films that
    have exceptional motion shots and try re-creating one or try a technique we
    have not addressed. For example: [12 Best Long Takes in Film History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLFHdagIw6o&t=61s).

Continue to cultivate a good learning perspective. Look upon the exercise and assignment for this unit as a fun adventure. Again, don’t be crippled by fear or perfectionism. Practice, practice, practice, and do you best. The fruits of this process will show up later.
