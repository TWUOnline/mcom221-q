## Visual Composition Exercise
*Due in Unit 3 (ungraded, but part of journal entry)*

For this exercise review Chapter 3 and the research you have done on design
elements and principles.

Then go out into your world and find and shoot five photos of still images that
reveal your understanding of strong design. As an incentive to explore,
experiment, and learn rather than just trying to get a good grade, this
assignment will not be graded. But this does not mean you should take lightly as
explained below.

### Visual Composition Guidelines

-   Goal: You must explore and conduct research on visual composition principles
    and techniques and integrate this exploration and what was learned in class
    into your assignment.

-   You must photograph **five still images** with your cell phone or
    photography camera. Each of the images must reveal **four different**
    compositional elements, principles and/or techniques covered above, e.g.,
    Symmetry, Leading Lines, Rule of Thirds, etc. The **fifth image** will
    express an principle or element that we have not addressed above such as the
    use of frame within a frame, triangular shapes, the rule of odds, etc.

-   Remember: Strong compositions often have robust, eye-catching symmetry,
    harmony, repetition, and/or balance and we can add depth to a frame through
    the use of foreground, middle ground, and background objects.

-   **Important Note**: You can shoot this assignment in landscape (horizonal
    format) or portrait (vertical format). However, unless for special reasons
    the rest of the film assignments in this course will be shot in normal film
    horizontal format.

-   In addition, you must find a photograph or image that expresses a theme to
    you. (Your images do not have to do this and can be formal studies, e.g.,
    focused on design rather than meaning or “message.”) Label this file with
    your Name and Theme Image (but not the theme itself). You will then ask your
    classmates what they think the theme is and why and then you will give your
    interpretation.

-   As you review your images in class your classmates will tell you what
    element or principle you were trying to convey and what did and did not work
    with your image. Try not to be defensive. Their feedback will help you to
    see if you have communicated your intent visually. Another sign of a
    professional is that he or she is willing to learn from mistakes: See
    websites like the following to foster a growth mentally approach to
    criticism: “[Taking Constructive Criticism Like a Champ](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ).”

-   You must write up a brief statement of what you learned from your research
    and your experience from this exercise including feedback from your peers in
    your course journal. Be sure to include the websites and/or important images
    that helped you better understand visual composition. This write-up should
    be about 1 to 2 pages in length. This write up is to you and to reflect on
    and better understand your work and should go into your course journal or
    log book to help you on your final exam.

-   Do not “doctor” or “Photoshop” the images. Do not get coaching. Do the
    assignment yourself. You will learn and grow more from your mistakes as well
    as your successes. If you want to reveal how Photoshop can improve an image
    you can show this after your presentation, if we have time to show it. This
    is optional.

-   You cannot use photos or images that you shot before the start of this
    course. The goal is force you to intentionally integrate the concepts
    addressed here into your work. You will gyp yourself of a valuable learning
    experience if you short cut the process.

-   You must label the images with your name and Number One, Two, Three, etc. Do
    not label the image with the name of the element or principle. You will
    present your images to the class and we will see if your audience is able to
    identify the technique you have used. This will be valuable feedback.

-   You will be emailed a Google Drive or Cloud storage box link to upload your
    images to a folder with your name on it for the course. (Later if you are
    working with a partner or team you must each individually upload your
    project to your personal folder.) You will have your own folder and you must
    never tamper with, delete, or alter other student’s work. Doing so will
    result in a failure in the course. Once loaded in the drive for the course
    you must not delete your work without permission from the professor.

-   Be sure to backup this assignment and all others by emailing your assignment
    and images to yourself or copying them to an external drive, flash drive,
    the Cloud, etc. **This course will not except excuses for lost or destroyed
    assignments** such as "my computer died" or "my files disappeared." Backing
    up work is the sign of a professional.

-   Please don’t wait until the last minute to do this assignment or you will
    waste your time and that of your peers if you rush it. Finding arresting
    images takes time and most of the first ones you shoot will be discarded.

-   If you are exploring an area where it might involve danger, bring a friend
    or family member along to help “watch your back.” A key theme of this course
    will be "safety first."

! **HINT**: If you find an interesting subject, element, or principle to shoot, explore the best angle to shoot it from, which often is not the first one you choose.
