## Topic 5: Creating a Scriptment

Our goal in this Unit is to find and create a strong story to film to shoot and edit so that it shines with excellence. The following steps will help you prepare a shooting script that will make pre-production, production, and post-production flow better.

  - Create a step outline.

  - Create a scriptment.

Your scriptment should be written in a way that someone who reads it should be able to visualize and hear your film.
