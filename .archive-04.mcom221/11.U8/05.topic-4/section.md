# Topic 4: Script and Story Development

Our goal in this unit is to find and create a strong story to film. As we have seen, brainstorming is a great method to help do this.

Once you have created a story concept that inspires you pitch it to the class to see if other classmates want to join you in your project.

Once you have your team in place you will then follow the process for creating a shooting script for pre-production and production.
