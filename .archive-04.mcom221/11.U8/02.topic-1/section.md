## Topic 1: Types of Film

There are three main types of short films that we can do for the project ahead:

  - **Classical Narrative**

  - **Documentary**

  - **Experimental, *Avant-Garde*, and Surreal Cinema**

Most of you will probably choose the classical narrative, but you are free to do the other two with the caveat that experimental/*avant-garde* films are far more challenging than they might appear. If you choose this type discuss it with your instructor.

As a transferable skill, like in many industries and businesses, smart filmmakers look for a market before they commit too much time and money to a film project. Others of course rely on their intuition and passion. Either way, it is wise to see what those who distribute or stream and screen short films, such as festivals and competitions, look for in making their choices. Their criteria can you vet the quality of your story and its execution.
