#### Activity 5.5: Exercise for Applying Grammar of Film

Now that you have done the theory, it is time to practice and apply what you have learned. Be sure to use both sides of your brainâ€”the conscious, intentional shot logic part and the intuitive, feeling, follow your gut and take a risk part. Learning to combine both will help you grow immensely in your creativity.

For this exercise you will engage in street photography, that is, go out into your local world and explore it through your cell phone camera lens and capture photos that use at least ten different shot sizes, subject framing, subject angles, and camera angles and heights.

Share your four best shots with your classmates and log in your journal what learned from your street photography and exploring of camera angles.
