# Course Resources

  - The course textbook is: Vankevich, N.. (2019). *Digital Filmmaking: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Mastering the Craft.* Epub. . The instructor will provide students an e-copy of the text.

  - Module links provided in Moodle and Course Text.

  - IMPORTANT NOTE: The units of this course correspond well with the chapters of the assigned textbook. Students must study both the units and the assigned chapters from the course text. Sometimes the material will overlap, but often the unit material and the chapter material will support and augment each other.

  - Before you begin each unit, encourage students to skim the sections of the required chapter. Then, read through how the unit is organized on Moodle (e.g. learning outcomes, topics, learning activities). Remind the students to create journal entries based on their reflections and responses to the course text and Moodle units.

  - Remind students to take notes on the course text and units. Questions or points of clarification can also be noted. This can act as a personal resource or study guide for students. The online text also has useful resources to help you study. Be sure to watch the videos. This process will reinforce what they are learning and help them do well in the course.

  - Facilitators will have access to the online textbook, in case they want to make notes, highlight content, etc.
