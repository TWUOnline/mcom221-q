Storyboard the scenes from your scriptment you plan to film. You can do this alone but it will be better if at least the director and cinematographer for you project work on this together. Ideally everyone on the team should work on this so that you will bond and have a unified vision of how to stage and shoot your shots.

**Helpful Hint**: Remember your locations will determine a lot of how you can and cannot shoot a scene. A drone will not work in a small room. Therefore, be sure to scout your locations and take pictures of them as you desing your storyboards and shot lists. Be sure to also confirm that the locations will be available for your shooting schedule.
