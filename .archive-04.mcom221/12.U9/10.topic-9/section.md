## Topic 9: The Final Steps

Bravo. Once you have reached this stage of this Unit and the previous one you should be well-equipped to produce and film your movie.

You will then have to edit it. This section adds some new techniques that can help elevate your film project to a higher level, namely Split Edits. If you can, add this to the editing of your film, as well as L cuts and J cuts. They will make your film flow better and be more engaging and enjoyable. It might also help win you an award in the course.
