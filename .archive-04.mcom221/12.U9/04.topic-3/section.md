## Topic 3: Continuity

Continuity, or the non-distracting and motivated and smooth flow of action, is another skill set essential to the filmmakerâ€™s took kit. Some techniques you have already studied, but others are new and important.

The following are the major techniques of continuity that you must focus on:

  - Matching Action

  - Directional Continuity

  - Eyeline Continuity

  - 180-Degree Rule

  - 30-Degree Rule

Each of these individually and as a group will help immensely in creating well-constructed, well-motivated, and audience-engaging films.
