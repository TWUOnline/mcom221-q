## Topic 4: Post-Production

The final phase of the filmmaking process involves post-production where all elements of pre-production and production are “cut” or stitched together to create a finished film.

Like production, the post process is hands-on and labor intensive. If done digitally, it involves using software such as Adobe Premier Pro, Apple Final Cut, Avid, DaVinici Resolve, etc. to edit the footage and make transitions such as fades, dissolves, wipes, etc. (to be covered later). This can be easy but a lot of work goes into choosing the best and rights shots and editing them together.

There are four phases to cutting the picture of a film:

  - Assembly Cut: where the shots are placed together in proper order without trimming them.
  - Rough Cut: where you begin to “trim the fat” from the beginning and end of shots to get a feel for how the story will flow.
  - Fine Cuts: which will involve multiple versions as you trim or cut shots and scenes that do not work. You can further hone the film of any “excess” fat that does not add to the effective presentation of the story and characters.
  - Final Cut: which is the “locked” picture version that the composer and sound design people need to add music and sound effects to precise moments in the story.

In addition to cutting the picture, post-production also entails:

  - **Sound Design** where the right music and sound effects are chosen and added.

  - **Titling and Graphics** when the opening and ending film credits appear and any special written material that will appear on the screen such as: FIVE YEARS EARLIER.

  - **Test Screening** your film to those you trust to make sure the story works and is clear, and to test how an audience will respond.

  - **Color Correcting** where the flow of the color and light and dark nature of the images appears seamless and appropriate. This is where you correct over exposed and under expose shots or those with the wrong color temperature. (Look these terms up in the film glossary you are using during this course. Refer to Activity 1.2 in Unit 1)

  - **Audio Mixing** which involves finding the right levels and balance between the sound elements such as dialogue, music, sound effects, room tone, etc.

  - **Format Delivery**: What resolution will you use to export your film project? The wrong one can undermine the quality of your film.
As can be gleaned, there is a lot to post-production but by carefully studying and practicing the units ahead it will make it easier.

If you are feeling overwhelmed and intimidated, you will not be alone. This is a lot to do and learn and this is why the bigger film projects can be done with team members.
