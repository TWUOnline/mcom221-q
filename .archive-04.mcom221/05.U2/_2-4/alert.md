#### Activity 2.4: Reflect and Share

Based on this unit and your reading of Chapter 2 in the course text, share in your journal and with your Facilitator and classmates why knowing the overall process is important and what you learned most from this unit.

Share also if you are feeling intimidated. Remember all but one of the graded assignments will be done in teams so you will not have to do it all alone.
