## Topic 2: Pre-Production

Like most things in life, if you do not have a strong foundation, what follows after will wobble. Proper pre-production is the foundation of an excellent film (and your up-coming exercises). The better you plan something, the better the result.

There are many elements to pre-production. When followed properly they enhance the 5 Cs of successful filmmaking (see the **Why Pre-Production is Important** section in Chapter 2 of the course text):

  - Creativity
  - Calmness
  - Co-ordination
  - Coherence
  - Consistency

Proper pre-production involves many important general steps (see **What Proper Pre-Production Entails** section in Chapter 2 of the course text).

  - Planning
  - Anticipation
  - Strategizing
  - Testing

As can be gleaned from above, pre-production helps ensure that a film project maximizes the creative process and minimizes chaos, confusion, and uncertainty—the enemies of a good film.

There are many steps in the prep-production process highlighted in Chapter 2. (See **Successful Steps of Pre-Production**.)

They involve:

  - Creating a viable concept for a project

  - Knowing who the audience is and genre requirements (people who like comedy want to laugh, people who like horror want to be scared)

  - Creating a script to film

  - Creating storyboards and shot lists

  - Pitching your project to get funding, actors, crew members, etc.

  - Budgeting the cost of the film

  - Getting your actors and the right crew

  - Finding locations and props

  - Scheduling the shoot

  - Testing your gear to make sure you know how to use it and that it works properly.

As can be seen, there is a lot involved before we film. Luckily, we will start with short exercises which will take minimal pre-production and gradually build to the more detailed aspects later.

Note: The lion’s share of this unit and Chapter Two in the course book is devoted to pre-production to emphasize how important this phase is. Most people might think production is the most important part of the filming process. In fact, each phase is. In Hollywood the development process (creating the screenplay) and pre-production for a film often takes far longer than production. Post-Production is also a longer process than production when a major film is involved.
