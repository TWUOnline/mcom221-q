#### Activity 7.7: Pitching your Project

You will have to develop a montage concept to pitch such as a day in the life of street vendors, or a music video, or visualizing a poem or something from the Bible. So review the brainstorming techniques in the previous unit and come up with at least 10 concepts and then choose the one that most appeals to you.

Then review the section on *Pitching* in Chapter Two of the course text. Study *How to Pitch Your Montage Project* and *Steps for an Effective Pitch* in the Chapter 7 and practice doing your pitch before a friend or family member or to an imaginary audience before making the actual pitch to your course members.

**Note**: Do not skimp on practicing your pitch. The more you practice it you will gain confidence and know how to present your concept in an effective way.


### Guidelines for Pitching a Film Project

**Purpose of a Pitch:** To get people to work on your project, commission your
project, fund your project, help with your project, distribute your project,
etc. Pitches also help you to clarity what you want to do and why.

**Steps to a Good Pitch**

1.  If you can, open with a teaser or dramatic statement or question.

2.  Meet and greet your audience—minimum chitchat, professionals are busy, busy
    people.

3.  Dress appropriately—relative to the audience and the project. Artists dress
    “artsy”; corporate people dress with business attire.

4.  Project the proper persona (your personality and character)—knowledgeable,
    credible, trustworthy, smart, clever, etc.

5.  Explain your qualifications, background, and why you are competent and the
    right person to do the project. If you do not have a demo reel then sell
    people with your passion, e.g., WHIPLASH filmmaker.

6.  Give the title of the film/project—titles shape perception and expectations.

7.  State the Genre—comedy, drama, documentary, etc. This also shapes
    perceptions and expectations. The basic concept of a comedy should make us
    laugh or at lease smile.

8.  Give the Unique Angle or Hook of your project—what makes it stand out as
    something different and catchy/edgy/clever, etc. E.g., SHOE IN LOVE, a
    romantic comedy from the POV of a pair of cowboy boots and stilettos falling
    in love with each other. The special angle concept is to use foot ware as
    the main characters and the execution hook is to shoot POVs at foot level or
    from the shin down.

9.  Briefly state the logline or basic concept: a one or two sentence
    description of the core story. E.g., a young, bored dirt farmer gets a
    message that he has to help rescue a faraway princes and save the universe.
    STAR WARS.

10. Project synopsis—succinctly tell the beginning/middle/end of your story or
    if a documentary the main message of your doc.

11. Summarize your end goal: to wow my audience with extraordinary nature
    photography or to make my audience laugh, cry, fall in love, etc.

12. Explain what you need—cast, crew, funding, etc.

13. Ask for Questions—also be open to criticism and constructive comments and
    feedback.

14. Gratitude—be thankful and gracious even if your project is not received well
    or as anticipated. Burning bridges is wrongheaded. Pitching can be a
    training ground for how to deal with rejection.

*Examples of Types of Montage Projects to Pitch*

The goal of your Montage Short assignment (see the syllabus) will be to explore how to make an effective montage-based film that uses picture and sound editing to convey meaning, emotion, story and/or mood.

For this project, you can:

:fa-minus: Create a music video where you take a song and create images that
        express the mood, feeling, meaning, etc. of the song.

:fa-minus: Find a poem, fairy tale, or passage from the Bible and “visualize” and
        enhance it with music and sound effects.

:fa-minus: Create a chase scene—someone steals something and is on the run and
        using music and sound effects to enhance the excitement and dynamism.

:fa-minus: Create a love or horror or thriller story —use can use dialogue but
        there must be an edited montage—a series of edited shots that convey the
        mood, meaning etc.

:fa-minus: Etc.
