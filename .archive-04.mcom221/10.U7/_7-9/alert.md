#### Activity 7.9: Feedback and Self-Assessment for Montage Project

Once you have edited your project and exported it, you are ready to show it to your classmates and instructor. This should be an exciting time as you screen the fruits of your labor and creativity.

As mentioned previously, film is a public medium and subject to critique and evaluation.

The following criteria can help us better evaluate our own work and that of others and to give constructive criticism on how to improve:
  - Overall did the montage work?
  - Did the music and/or sound effects work well with the images?
  - Did the montage convey a mood, emotion, a story and/or theme (some insight into life)? If so, what was it?
  - Were the shots well composed, motivated, and appropriately smooth or in some cases jarring depending on what is being communicated?
  - Were the cuts timed well? If not, where did they not work well?
  - Were the transitions appropriate and effective?
  - Was the action followed well?
  - Was there a sufficient variety of shots?
  - Were some shots or images too repetitive?
  - Were the shots and images interesting and noteworthy?
  - What did you like best about the project?
  - What suggestions would you offer to make it better?

Evaluate and critique the work of your peers helping them to see what worked and did not work in their montage and why. When possible give suggestions of how something could have been done better. Remember the tone and substance of our critiques should be one that offers encouraging constructive insight and that helps each other to grow and improve their craft.

Write in your journal what you learned about your project and yourself from the montage projects.

Use the following questions to guide you:
  - What was the best lesson I learned?
  - What did I do well? Why?
  - What did not work out as well as I planned? Why?
  - What can I do better next time?
  - What was the quality of my experience working with a partner?
  - If I did not work with a partner, could the project have been better if I had one?
  - How did this experience help me grow as a person and as a professional?
  - What did I learn new about myself?

Be sure to note which films and filmmakers had the best cinematography, editing, story, creativity, etc. so that you can consult this when you vote on the awards at the end of the course.
