#### Activity 7.6: Digital Editing Software

Read the Digital Editing Software section in the text.

Find the digital video editing program you want to use and learn how to do basic editing with it. Basic editing using cuts, dissolves, fades, and wipes titling will be all you need to learn for your montage project.

The Filmora website gives an overview of the type of features you want to look for in <a href= "https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwvdXpBRCoARIsAMJSKqIlTxG4fGMlWHTHsBPoUVzFuLky1e9MATKGx5Ju5Cu356k9li7lJLwaAj2JEALw_wcB"> video editing software. </a>

For free and inexpensive Android-based video software see:

Or search for best cellphone or DSLR video editing software such as <a href= "https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/511-best-video-editing-apps.html"> Best Picks 12 Best Video Editing Apps for Phones and Tablets </a>.

**Note**: When you pitch your montage project, see who already has editing software and who knows how to use it and try to join with them if you are a bit of a “tech-phobic.” If you can’t find someone, challenge yourself and learn something new. You will learn and grow a lot doing this.
