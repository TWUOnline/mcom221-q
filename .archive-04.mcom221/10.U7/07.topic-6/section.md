## Topic 6: Pitching Your Montage Project

Because the montage project is more complicated, you are encouraged to work in teams to create an excellent montage. You can do the project solo if you feel you have the experience and understanding of the gear and software to create it.

The reason almost all larger-scale film projects are done in teams with a lot of different crew positions is that over time, people specialize in their skill-sets and bring better expertise to a project. This is why film crews have a cinematographer, production designer, wardrobe, hair and make-up specialists, prop masters, special effects experts, etc. (You should be consulting your film terms website if you do not know these positions.)

For this project, ideally you will have a team of two people. One to come up with the concept and film it and the other to edit it. In reality, both members will share the idea development, shooting, and editing. The important thing is that you both share equally in the work. (In some cases if the montage is highly complex or sophisticated you can have 3 or 4 members on the team as long as everyone does their fair share.)

In order to find the find teammate, you will pitch your project to the class to see who wants to work on it.

Pitching is a process central to the film and television industry. It involves an individual or team presenting their film project concept and why it is important and to a special audience such as a producer, agent, studio or television executive, distributor, film competition, etc. Everyone, no matter how big or important, has to pitch to those in the industry to find the money, resources, actors, crew, and/or distribution for their project.

Pitching is a vital part of filmmaking and it is a great transferable skill to learn since you will have to pitch in many professions and industries today.
