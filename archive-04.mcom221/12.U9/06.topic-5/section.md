## Topic 5: Shot Lists

Once you have your scriptment describing all of the action and dialogue you will film and have storyboarded your film, you can now create a shot list which will help ensure you get all the shots needed for your coverage.

It is better if your whole production team gives feedback on the shot list. Ultimately, it is the director who will make the final choice but hearing what other team members feel can help cut down on mistakes.

Study the Shot List Example in Chapter Nine to see what you need to include.
