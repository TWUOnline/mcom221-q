## Topic 2: Principles of Composition

In addition to elements of design, there are also principles or general rules that help give structure to visual compositions and which can also lend meaning or a theme to an image. Elements are specific things whereas principles are more general. Here are four that the course text focuses on:

**1. Balance**  
**2. Rule of Thirds**  
**3. Repetition and Patterns**  
**4. Combinations**  

There are many other principles such as the use of triangles and frame within a frame in compositions.
