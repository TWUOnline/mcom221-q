## Topic 1: Elements of Composition

At heart, visual composition means the intentional arrangement or conscious activity of constructing the “ingredients” of an image. As we grow in our filmmaking craft, we must continually be aware of what takes place within the frame (the border of a picture or a film shot). Focusing on a single image can help train us to do this.

! **Important Tip**: Before continuing below, study this overview of the building blocks of composition in art: [The Visual Elements: The Building Blocks of Composition in Art](http://www.artyfactory.com/art_appreciation/visual-elements/visual-elements.html).

The following are some of the formal elements that make up the design and structure of an image. However, it is important to remember that subject matter and composition are linked and therefore do not get locked in to rigidly adhering to what you are learning. Many masters break the rules but they know them well before they do so.

- Line  
- Shape (geometric, organic, natural  
- Colour (hues, intensities, symbolism)  
- Texture (tactile feel) 
- Value (shadows and shading)
- Form (3-D, 2-D)  
- Space (positive/objects); (negative/space between objects)
- Depth (foreground/mid-ground/background)
