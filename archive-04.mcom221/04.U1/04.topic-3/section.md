## Topic 3: 15 Tips for Doing Your Best

The following will help you to not just do well in this Film project, but will make it fun and more enjoyable and hopefully be one of your favourite courses ever:

1.  ***Keep your eye on the prize.*** Creating an excellent project and growing as a professional and better person through the process.

2.  ***Meeting Deadlines.*** Being on time is vital in any profession, especially in filmmaking where the cost of feature film shoots can be thousands of dollars per hour. Plan your time and schedule accordingly so that you make your due date. Failure to do so will result in reduced marks on your assignment.

3.  ***Avoiding Distractions.*** In our Internet-cell phone era we are inundated and surrounded by 24/7 distractions. If we succumb to them we will not meet our deadlines and thus delay our professional and personal development. Learning to discern what is vital and what is the tyranny of the unimportant and unnecessary urgent is a critical skill to develop today. Focus on it and you will go further in the course. (Tip: turn off all notifications on your cell phone. In fact, turn off or put your cell phone away while you are working on your Film course. You will find that this will help you to focus on and finish your assignments quicker and with more creativity.

4.  ***Focussing on the positive***. Most of the assignments ahead will be challenging. Cultivate a “can do attitude.” For context think about your taking a piano lesson course. You would not expect to sit down and immediately play chords and songs. You would have to learn to play the notes, then chords, then songs over a period of time. Filmmaking is similar. There are notes to learn (film shots), chords to learn (film scenes), before we can create melodies (film sequences) and songs (full films).

5.  ***It takes time and practice to master film***. If you find you have time, or if you are truly interested in learning the world of film or becoming a filmmaker, I encourage you to go beyond the course exercises. For example, continue to find and shoot interesting visual compositions (they are all around you) during the course, or practice fascinating and more complicated motion shots and two and three person shots. The more you do this the faster you will grow in your craft. Think about musicians. They practice over and over everyday. 

6.  ***Study the practical tips and helpful hints in these units***. Pay attention to them. They will help fast-track your skills growth.

7.  ***Find and do what you love***. During this course you will discover things you love to do and those that you do not. As a filmmaker, every skill set is vital for the final production – but you will discover which roles you are better at and enjoy the most. Even if you do not go into filmmaking as a career this self-insight will be invaluable as you make life decisions ahead.

8.  ***Make a firm commitment to succeed***. When we are double-minded or not sure of what we want, we will waiver and fall prey to distraction and self-sabotage. Resolve not to give up as you make your projects despite what “Murphy’s Law” tosses your way. (To be covered later.)

9.  ***Strive for balance***. The emphasis on excellence and professional and personal development must not make us “lose our soul.” Too many people get caught up in goals and ambition and end up failing in their marriage and relationships. Remember we are physical, mental, spiritual, emotional, and relational beings and must find a balance that lets us grow in each part equally. This is the key to personal flourishing.

10. ***Create strong and healthy relationships***. During this course you will discover a lot about yourself and others. Some people will be easy to work with and some won’t. Some will be diligent and some won't. Choose your teammates wisely and if you have a winning rapport with them, you might want to work with them on the next project. One of the keys to success in the professional world is cultivating strong and fruitful relationships. Start the process here.

11. ***Follow your intuition***. If you’ve never experimented with following your deeper instincts or “gut feelings” try it during this course. Often this will take you to new creative places. It might not always work but you will learn a lot from doing so.

12. ***Take risks***. We don’t grow unless we try new things and fail. They key is not to get discouraged but to shake off a loss and fight to win again.

13. ***Practice, practice, practice. Learn, learn, learn***. Your best competition is continually practicing and learning their craft. So should you. You need to cultivate both a strong work ethic and a smart ethic. Take the time to think things through before launching into something.

14. ***Take responsibility for yourself and your future***. Playing the blame game or the victim or continually making excuses will not get you ahead in life.

15. ***Find inspiring quotes and pin them to your computer or wall***. Most of us need encouragement especially when the going gets tough. Seek out inspiration that helps keep you going. The following strike some of the themes of this course:

! *"Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."* - Winston S. Churchill

! *"It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation."* - Herman Melville

! *"You will become clever through your mistakes."* - German Proverb in "The Talent Code"
