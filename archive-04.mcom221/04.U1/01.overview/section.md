# Unit 1: Project Excellence and Professionalism

## Overview

Welcome to MCOM 221! You are about to embark on a creative adventure. The specific goal of this journey is to create attention-grabbing  and alluring short films. However, the general goal is far more valuable as you learn things about yourself you never knew. This course will equip you with the knowledge to develop transferable life skills that will help you in your career and professional life after you complete your education.

In addition, there is a larger element of this course that connects us to people from the past, present, and future. Namely, storytelling.

According to communications theorist Walter Fischer, human beings are more than *Homo sapiens*, we are Homo *narrans*, man the storyteller. Storytelling is hardwired into our brains and our cultures and history. Stories are how we make sense of our life and our world. This is why religion, philosophy, literature, and myth have been vital to human culture and understanding. Even science is a story—it tells us how the world works. But it cannot tell us why. Only story-based meaning can reveal why life is important, how we should live our lives, and why there is something rather than nothing. Think of the Bible. If one were to take out the stories, it would be a thin book.

Don’t let these ideas scare you. This is a creative course not a philosophic one. The point here is that as you increase your storytelling skills—a vital part of this course—you will join the community of narrators throughout human history who have shared their wisdom, insight, and understanding. This knowledge serves as the foundation for building identities, developing traditions, and discovering the types of meaning that make life worth living across all cultures.

This course will focus on one aspect of narratives, namely visual storytelling. How do we use pictures (and sounds) to create meaning and emotionally connect people to ourselves and each other? This will be the deeper theme operating beneath the surface of this course. (In film terms it will be the subtext beneath the text.)

In practical terms, the better you are at communicating stories (relative to each profession), the better you will be at your job. Fasten your seat belt, you are about to find out why we have focused on the above to start this course.
