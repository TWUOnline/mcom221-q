#### Activity 1.5: Reflection on Life Skills

Which of the life skills above are important to you and why? Log this in your journal. Which life skill(s) can you add to the list? Share your responses with your Facilitator and classmates.

**NOTE**: Be sure to revisit these journal entries on Tips to Do Well and Transferable Life Skills as you monitor your progress during the course. One of the actives in Unit Ten will involve your writing a summary of the best lessons you learned from the course and about yourself. Again, this is a reminder of how important our course journal will be.
