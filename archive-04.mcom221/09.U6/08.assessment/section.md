## Assessment

**Grading Criteria for the In-Camera Assignment**

You will be given verbal feedback in the Learning Lab by your instructor and peers after you show your film. You will also receive written feedback by your instructor on your write-up submission.

The following questions will be discussed by your peers and considered by your instructor concerning your film:
  - Did you communicate a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end?
  - Did you express a clear genre and was the coverage (type of shots used) appropriate for it?
  - Did your film reveal that you understand how to use film grammar and syntax?
  - Did you have a sufficient variety of shot sizes, angles, heights, framing, etc.?
  - Were your motion shots motivated?
  - Were the shots in focus and were they smooth or did they have bumps or unnecessary movements or elements?
  - Did you follow the linear action of the story well?
  - Were your shots well composed? Appropriate lead room, head room, eye vectors, etc.?

1.  You will be adjudicated on how well you follow the “classical” approach to camera work and storytelling we have covered, how creative and compelling your story and its execution are within the limits of an introductory course, and how well you follow and execute the guidelines above.
2.  This project will count as 10% of you grade and the breakdown will be:
    - Story 5%
    - Visual execution 5%
3.  Beyond following the guidelines above, your mini-film will merit the following grades:

| A | Excellent camera shots and compositions that tell a compelling story. |
| - | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| B | Above average camera shots, compositions, and story.                  |
| C | Average camera shots, compositions, and story.                        |
| D | Unacceptable camera shots, compositions, and poorly done story.       |
| E | Failure to do the activity at all levels.                             |

> See the course syllabus for more detail on the qualitative criteria for a grade.

Now that you know what must be done and how you will be evaluated, check to make sure your story can accomplish the above requirements and that you can execute it accordingly.

  - Define what constitutes an “In-Camera” film
  - Analyze and apply a story template
  - Determine how to tell a visual-centered story well
  - Create a short simple story to film
