## Topic 1: In-Camera Project and Its Benefits

Your first film project will be something you might never do again if you go into the film and television world. You will shoot a short film with no dialogue in the exact sequential order that it will appear when you screen it for classs.

Almost always, films are shot out of sequence to save time and money by doing all the scenes in one location at a time and then all the scenes in another location at one time, etc.

Here you will be forced to shoot at a location and move to the next, and if the first location is needed you will have to go back to it. Why do this? There are multiple benefits, as the course text chapter highlights. Some of them include:

  - Forcing you to think of a simple story that fits these parameters.
  - Challenging you to plan your shots in a linear, well-thought out way.
  - Making you attentive to each shot and how relates to the previos ones.
  - Challenging your brainstorming and film logic skills.
