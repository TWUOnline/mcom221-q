## Assignment: Final Exam: Self-Assessment / Journal (30%)
*Due end of Unit 10*

**Self-Assessment**

It is hoped that you have enjoyed the process and discovered that you now know a
lot about filmmaking and yourself and can better deal with challenges and
adversity, especially when Murphy’s Law strikes or things do not work out as
planned. This has been the overarching goal here—to offer you a chance to
develop your creative potential and to acquire transferable life skills that you
can use in your future life and career.

To help you solidify what you have learned, conduct a final detailed
self-assessment of what you have experienced and how you have grown as a person
and as a professional. The following Guidelines will help you do this.

-   Review Chapter One about excellence, personal and professional development,
    and transferable life skills and reflect on specifically how you have grown.

-   Refer to your journal where you have made comments about skills you have
    learned, obstacles you have overcome, epiphanies about your strengths and
    weaknesses, etc.

-   Express what impacted you the most and your vision and goals for the future.

-   When pondering and writing your responses, don’t forget that in addition to
    filmmaking skills there are many types of skills and character development
    dimensions that you have undergone during your creative adventures:

-   Graphics skills
-   Story skills
-   Teamwork skills
-   Persistence skills
-   Passion skills
-   Creativity skills
-   Cognitive skills
-   Analytic skills
-   Etc.
