## Assignment 1: In-Camera Exercise (10%)
*Due end of Unit 6*

As stated in Chapter Six once I have this overall concept I would then
brainstorm specific shots and scenes to film to make sure I can film what I
wrote and that it matches the criteria of a doable, visually centered
“mini-movie” that encapsulates all the you have learned so far. Such as:

-   A 1.5 to 2.5-minute film of any genre that does not contain dialogue.
-   A story that has a clear beginning, middle, and end.
-   The use of a variety of shot sizes, angles, and framing as per the Film
    Grammar and Syntax Section to visually tell the story.
-   Have at least three motivated moving shots involving following the action.

**Guidelines for In-Camera Project**

-   You must explore and experiment with visual-centered storytelling. That is,
    make a film where the images and shots tell the story.

-   There must be no dialogue. A character can say “yes,” or “no,” i.e. if they
    are receiving a phone call but you cannot have the character explain things.
    Work on letting your visuals do this.

-   This assignment must be an “In-Camera” project, that is, one that is shot in
    linear sequence from the beginning to the end. It should be about 1.5 to 2.5
    minutes long. It can be a bit shorter or longer but not much.

-   Your mini-movie should have a clear beginning, middle, and end as per the
    template provided earlier.

-   You must choose a genre such as comedy, drama, horror, fantasy, etc. Nothing
    too elaborate but we should have a feel for the type of mini film you have
    done. (We will discuss and cover genre in more detail later.)

-   You must use a variety of shot sizes, heights, angles, framing, etc. that
    reveal you are understanding film grammar and syntax. There should be at
    least eight different types of shots.

-   You must have some linear movement where you use motion shots to follow the
    action. Review the unit on Motion shots.

-   Your shots must be have:

   -   Proper Lead Room
   -   Motivated Shot Movement
   -   Consistent Screen Direction
   -   Proper Eye-Line Vectors
   -   Proper Headroom

-   You must make sure your shots are motivated. Remember motivated means the
    camera and subject motion are matched or are in sync in a way that draws
    attention to the subject action and not the camera movement. Motivated also
    means the story and character(s) justify the shot.

-   You are not allowed to edit the film. You can trim the beginning of a shot
    where you call “action” and the end to remove the time before the actors
    begin acting and the excess at the end of the shot. You are not allowed to
    use transitions like dissolves and fades (covered later.) You must only use
    cuts to butt the shots up against each other. You can use Imovie, Fiolmora,
    or other software. There are plenty of tutorials on You Tube to show you how
    to use most software. Don’t waste your time on junky tutorials. You should
    be able to know a professional presentation when you see one.

-   The only music that can be used is that which is “diegetic,” that is sound
    which has a source on-screen in your shots, e.g., a CD player in a car.

-   Given that you cannot edit this film make sure you rehearse the shots to get
    them right.

-   This project can be shot on your cell phone or with a DSLR camera if you
    have one.

-   You must shoot and direct this project yourself.

-   Remember: The important thing is to focus on your story and telling it in an
    interesting visual way through good compositions, motivated movement, a
    variety of shot sizes and camera angles, etc. The “Fairy Tale” narrative
    pattern can help you create a solid story. Go for a “twist” if you can, as
    covered in class.

-   Again a reminder: Please don’t wait until the last minute to do this
    assignment or you will waste your time and ours if you rush it. Creating
    story and filming it well will take more time than you think.

-   You must submit a write-up of what you attempted to do and what you learned
    from this exercise, especially from the feedback you received from your
    peers. This write-up must be emailed to <ned.vankevich@twu.ca> by the due
    date which is to be determined.

-   Be sure to upload your film to the appropriate Google Drive or Cloud folder
    and label your file with your name, course, and the name of the assignment.
    E.g., Alfred Hitchcock, MCOM 221, In-Camera Project

-   N.B. Backup this assignment and all others by either emailing your
    assignment and images to yourself or copying them to an external drive,
    flash drive, the Cloud, etc. **This course will not accept excuses for lost
    or destroyed assignments** such as “my computer died” or “my files
    disappeared.” Backing up work is the sign of a professional.

-   You will be graded on this activity as per the following guidelines.

**Grading Criteria for the In-Camera Assignment**

You will be given verbal feedback in class by your peers after you show your
film and written feedback by your instructor on your write-up submission.

The following questions will be discussed by your peers and considered by your
instructor concerning your film:

-   Did you communicate a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end?
-   Did you express a clear genre and was the coverage appropriate for it?
-   Did your film reveal that you are understanding how to use film grammar and
    syntax?
-   Did you have a sufficient variety of shot sizes, angles, heights, framing,
    etc.?
-   Where you camera shots motivated?
-   Was the shot smooth or did they have bumps and divots that distracted us?
-   Did you follow the action well?
-   Were your shots well composed? Appropriate lead room, head room, eye
    vectors, etc.?

You will be evaluated on how well you follow the “classical” approach to
motion and storytelling we have covered and how creative and compelling you
are within the limits of an introductory course and how well you follow and  execute the guidelines above.

-   This project will count as 10% of you grade and the breakdown will be:

   - Story 5%
   - Visual execution 5%

-   Your mini-film will merit the following grades: (A), Excellent motivation
    and motion shots compositions that tell a compelling story (B), Above
    average motivations, motion shots, compositions, and story (C), Average
    motion shots and compositions and story (D), Unacceptable motion shots and
    compositions and poorly executed story (F) Failure to do the activity at all
    levels. See the course syllabus for more detail on the qualitative criteria
    for a grade.

Put another way:

-   Understanding and executing the assignment extremely well merits an (A)
-   Understanding and executing the assignment in a superior way merits a (B)
-   Understanding and executing adequately merits a (C)
-   Failing to understand and execute the assignment merits a (D to F)

Now that you know what must be done and how you will be evaluated check to make
sure your story can accomplish the above requirements that you can execute it
accordingly.
