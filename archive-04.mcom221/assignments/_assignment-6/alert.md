### Assignment: In-Camera Exercise (10%)

Having practiced working on composition and motion shots and learning about the variety and types of shot sizes and camera angles, you are now ready to apply all this knowledge and make your first film. Though it will be challenging, do not fear. You can do it.

For this exercise project you make an in-camera mini-movie. That is, take the story you have developed in this chapter and film it. The catch is that you must do it in sequence: “in camera.” Put another way, you must shoot the film in the order that it will be screened and you cannot edit it beyond butting shots up against each other and taking out the call for action or call for cut at the end of the shot.

The reason for this constraint of shooting all of the shots in their proper order and not using any editing beyond cutting the shots together is to help you intentionally plan your shots so that their meaning and mood flow and connect well.

This will most likely be the last time you will film this way, given that screenplays are shot out of sequence according to location, crew, cast, and equipment needs. But here your job is to plan a simple mini-movie and work on using composition, motion shots, and film grammar to visually tell your story with no dialogue or added music or sound effects. This might sound intimidating, but if you have been diligent in your previous film exercises work, you will soar.

The following guidelines must be adhered for your In-Camera film project:

**Guidelines for In-Camera Project**

1.  You must explore and experiment with visual-centered storytelling. That is, make a film where the images and shots tell the story without the use of dialogue and verbal explanation.
2.  There must be no dialogue. A character can say “yes,” “no,” or “okay” if receiving a phone call but you cannot have the character explain things. Work on letting your visuals do this.
3.  This assignment must be an “In-Camera” project, that is, one that is shot in linear sequence from the beginning to the end. It should be about 1.5 to 2.5 minutes long. It can be a bit shorter or longer but not much.
4.  Your mini-movie should have a clear beginning, middle, and end as per the template provided earlier.
5.  You must choose a genre such as comedy, drama, horror, fantasy, etc. Nothing too elaborate, but we should have a feel for the type of mini film you have done. (We will discuss and cover genre in more detail later.)
6.  You must use a variety of shot sizes, heights, angles, framing, perspectives, etc. that reveal your are understanding of film grammar and syntax. There should be multiple different types of shots and camera angles.
7.  You must have some linear movement where you use motion shots to follow the action. Review the previous sections on motion shots.
8.  Your shots must have:

  - Proper Lead Room
  - Motivated Shot Movement
  - Consistent Screen Direction
  - Proper Eye-Line Vectors
  - Proper Headroom


9.  You must make sure your shots are motivated. Remember motivated means the camera and subject motion are matched or are in sync in a way that draws attention to the subject action and not the camera movement. Motivated also means the story and character situations justify your choice of shots.
10. You are not allowed to edit the film and move shots into different positions on your timeline. You can trim the beginning of a shot where you call “action” and the end when the shot goes longer than needed. You are not allowed to use transitions like dissolves and fades (covered later). You must only use cuts to butt the shots up against each other. You can use Premiere, Final Cut, Imovie, Fiolmora, Windows Movie Maker, or other software. There are plenty of tutorials on Youtube to show you how to use most software. Don’t waste your time on junky tutorials. You should be able to know a professional presentation when you see one.
11. The only music that can be used is that which is “diegetic,” that is, sound which has a source on-screen in your shots, e.g., a CD player in a car, Alex playing in the background, etc.
12. You must shoot this project yourself. Later you will divide into teams where someone shoots and someone directs but for this exercise you must produce, write, direct, shoot, and edit this project by yourself. However, you can have someone show you how to use editing software if you need it.
13. Given that you cannot edit this film, make sure you rehearse the shots to get them right. Your actors will need at least two or three takes to get the movement right.
14. This project can be shot on your cell phone or with a DSLR camera if you have one.
15. Remember: The important thing is to focus on your story and telling it in an interesting visual way through good compositions, motivated movement, a variety of shot sizes and camera angles, etc. The “Fairy Tale” narrative pattern can help you create a solid story. Go for a “twist,” or surprised ending, if you can.
16. Please don’t wait until the last minute to do this assignment or you will waste your time and ours if you rush it. Creating story and filming it well will take more time than you think. And Murphy’s Law loves to bite procrastinators.
17. You must submit a write-up of what you attempted to do and what you learned from this exercise, especially from the feedback you received from your instructor and peers. This write-up must be emailed to <ned.vankevich@twu.ca> by the due date which will be determined during the course.
18. Be sure to upload your film to the course Cloud folder (this link will be sent to you) and label your file with your name, course, and the name of the assignment. E.g., Alfred Hitchcock, MCOM 221, In-Camera Project
19. N.B. Backup this assignment and all others by either emailing your assignment and images to yourself or copying them to an external drive, flash drive, the Cloud, etc. **This course will not accept excuses for lost or destroyed assignments,** such as my computer died or my files disappeared. Backing up work is the sign of a professional.
20. You will be graded on this activity as per the following guidelines.
