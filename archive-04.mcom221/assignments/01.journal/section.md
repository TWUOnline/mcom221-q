## Assignment: Film Journal
*Entries due for every unit; submitted at the end of the course.*
!! The Journal is worth **10%** of the 30% Final Exam/Self Assessment. 


**Guidelines for Journal**

-   The important thing is that you engage this course. Engagement means you
    actively and intentionally interact with the course material and course
    projects. Being actively engaged will enhance not only the new knowledge,
    ideas, and insights that you will encounter but will also elevate the
    overall experience you have.

-   For this course you will keep two journals.

-   **Journal One** will include:

    -   Your reflections on what you have learned from each of the Moodle Units
        and text book chapters—key take-away points. This could include concepts
        or techniques that stood out for you, it could also entail questions you
        might have, a list of resources you have consulted and what you learned
        from them, it can include breakthroughs you’ve had, *brainstorming
        ideas*, etc. This journal can serve as a great resource for when you
        have to develop story ideas later in the course.

    -   Be sure to cite specific page numbers from the course text.

    -   There is no minimum or maximum limit on your entries. You point is to
        show that you are engaging the material and if the bulk of your entries
        are very brief, a few sentences, you will lose marks for not giving
        evidence that you thoughtfully and reflectively engaged the course
        material. At the same time, don’t get paranoid and overly write. This
        should be an enjoyable process as you reflect on what you are learning.

    -   For help with how to keep a journal see resources such as [How to Start a Creative Journal](https://karenbanes.com/how-to-start-a-creative-journal) and [How to Journal Every Day for Increased Productivity, Clarity, and Mental Health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUTWo7_W0lc).

    -   This journal must also include a summary self-assessment of what you did
        during the course and the best overall lessons and insights you have
        learned. This summary assessment will be your last submission.

    -   Be sure to date each entry and label the dates clearly such as indented
        in the middle of the page.

    -   This journal will account for 20% of the 30 points so please do not take
        it lightly.

-   **Journal Two** will include:

    -   Your responses and critiques of your own film projects and those of all
        of your peers. This reflective critique will include what you think was
        done well and why and what was not done well and why.

    -   You can also include suggestions for ways you and your peers could have
        improved their work.

    -   Be sure to list the name of the student and his or her project and date
        these entries.

    -   This journal will account for 10% of the 30 points.

-   Put simply, these journals are designed to help you process your creative
    and cognitive experiences and give evidence of work done in the course.

-   Better marks will be given to the diligent student who actively engages and
    reflects on the reading material, modules, viewings, and discussions and who
    incorporate other research that was not discussed in class.

-   These journals must be submitted within four days of the end of the course.
    Be sure to label your journals properly. E.g., Alfred Hitchcock Journal One
    MCOM 221 and Alfred Hitchcock Journal Two MCOM 221.
