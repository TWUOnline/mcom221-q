### Assignment 2: Composition Exercise  
Congratulations! You have earned the right to shoot your first assignment for the course.

After you have done some composition research and explored great photographers and photos and their compositional techniques and aesthetics, review Chapter 3 and go out and find and create five outstanding visual compositions with your camera (cell phone, DSLR, etc.).  Share these with your family, friends, and peers and get their feedback about what worked and did not work. When you have found your best images upload them to the course online folder where the class assignments will be stored.  

Remember, the name of the game is to learn not to be perfect.  

Refer to the specific guidelines in the assessment section. Be sure to study them carefully.

#### Grading Criteria:
See the Assessments section for more details on your composition, as well as the grading criteria.
