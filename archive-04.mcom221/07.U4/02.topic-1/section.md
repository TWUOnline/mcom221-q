## Topic 1: Types of Cinematic Motion Shots
In Unit 3 we explored how excellent or effective still (non-moving) visual compositions are made. The elements and principles of such images apply to filmmaking too. However, film and video add new variables and techniques given that they deal with moving or motion pictures.

However, as we explore film motion, we must remember that film and video involve a series of still images being projected and that persistence of vision makes them appear connected. (See the first Helpful Hint in the course text Chapter 4.) This is why we need to incorporate what we have learned about visual composition as we create our “moving” pictures.

The main types of motion shots include:

- ZOOMS  
- PAN SHOTS
- SWISH OR WHIP PAN
- TILT SHOTS
- DOLLY
- DOLLY ZOOMS
- TRACKING
- ARCING
- FOLLOW SHOTS
- CRANE SHOTS
- 360-DEGREE TRACKING SHOTS
- SLIDERS
- GOPRO
- DRONES
- SHAKY CAMERA
