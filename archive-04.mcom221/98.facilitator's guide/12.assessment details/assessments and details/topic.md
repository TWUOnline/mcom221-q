This journal will also include a summary self-assessment of the work that students did and what they learned overall from the course. This journal will account for 20% of the 30 points.</p>
<p>2. Responses and critiques of their own film projects and those of all of their peers. This reflective critique will include what was done well and why. It will also include what was not done well and why, and any suggestions for improvement. This journal will account for 10% of the 30 points.</p></td>

The emphasis of the course will be on the theoretical and practical elements of

basic filmmaking. The projects will reveal how well they are grasping the course material, and the journals are designed to help the students to fully engage the course.

The following are objectives that must be met

for each exercise and project:

1\. The Composition exercises are designed to familiarize students to basic principles and practices that make for alluring and fascinating visual images.

2\. The Motion Shots exercises are designed to help students understand why movies are called moving pictures and to learn how to create motivated shots so that the camera and subject motion are in sync with each other.

3\. The Montage exercise is designed to allow the students to explore the way image and sound interplay in the creation of story, mood, concept, etc. and the important role editing plays in the flow and mix of picture and sound.

4\. The Short Film project is a capstone (final) exercise that allows the student to more fully integrate composition and cinematic motion into a fiction or non-fiction piece that communicates with the intended audience.

5\. The journals are designed to help the students process the course material and to more fully engage with both the course content and the work of their peers.

There are key documents for each assessment in this course. These are available online (in Moodle) for students. Be sure to review these important documents with students and contact the professor if any details are unclear.

!! See the Assessment section in Moodle for grading rubrics and key instructions for students.
