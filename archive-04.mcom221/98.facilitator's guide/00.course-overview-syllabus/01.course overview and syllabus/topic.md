### Course Overview for MCOM 221

!! The syllabus includes key information about the course schedule, assignments, and policies. Please read the full course syllabus in Moodle.

## Course Description
This introductory course in the art and craft of digital video production familiarizes students with the “classical” approach to cinematic aesthetics and techniques. Students work individually and collaboratively as they produce, shoot, and edit short films. Emphasis is placed on analyzing films from a filmmaker’s perspective.  

### Course Specifics
Motion picture and single camera film production have undergone major changes during the “digital revolution.”  Today more people have access to inexpensive high-end film gear than ever before. However, this does not mean the quality of productions has increased along with the quantity of great looking productions. To help remedy this situation, this course will introduce students to the seminal visual language, aesthetics, poetics, and techniques that enhance filmmaking.  As such, it will involve both a theoretical and an applied, or “hands-on,” approach to digital filmmaking.  In addition, students will be introduced to the process of critiquing film from a film artist’s perspective with an aim toward helping students gain confidence in the conceptual, narrative, and practical applications of digital-based film production.  Students will also be given the opportunity to work in creative, collaborative teams to produce several short video pieces as they face the multiple challenges of making excellent short films.
