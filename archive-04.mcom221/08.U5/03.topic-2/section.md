## Topic 2: Basic Shots and Their Descriptions

This is a vital section. You need to know the following shots and how to describe them because you will have to use this language to communicated to your crew. Few things are more frustrating for a film crew than the director or cinematographer not knowing what they want or how to name and describe a shot.

  - Extreme Long Shot (ELS)
  - Long Shot (LS) also called Wide Shot (WS)
  - Establishing Shot (ES)
  - Full Shot (FS)
  - Medium Long Shot (MLS) also known as Medium Wide Shot (MWS)
  - Cowboy Shot
  - Medium Shot (MS)
  - Medium Close Up (MCU)
  - Close Up (CU)
  - Extreme Close Up (ECU)

In addition to shot size we also designate film shots by who or what is in the frame and how they are positioned:

  - Single Shot
  - Two Shot
  - Three Shot
  - Group Shot
  - Over-The-Shoulder Shot
  - Reverse Shot
  - Point of View Shot (POV)
  - Reaction Shot
  - Cutaway
  - Cut-in and Insert
  - Combo Shot
