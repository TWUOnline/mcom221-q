#### Activity 5.1: Study, Read, and Explore

:fa-book: Find and consult a film glossary such as [Brooklyn College Film Glossary](http://userhome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/anthro/jbeatty/COURSES/glossary.htm).

Continue to read and study the one you like throughout this course and it will help you grow your film vocabulary and your understanding of the many components and processes involved in filmmaking. Set a goal to learn <span class="underline">5 new terms or concepts</span> each day. Bring 5 of the new terms to class and share one of them with your classmates. Listen closely to their terms and how your peers define them. This will enhance and re-enforce the concepts for everyone.

:fa-book: Read the first section of Chapter 5.
In your Film Journal, explain how frames and shots become scenes and sequences and how they add up to a complete film story.

:fa-book: Finally, study a web essay on how to build your intuition such as [21 Eye-Opening Ways To Develop Your Intuition](https://liveboldandbloom.com/04/self-improvement/develop-your-intuition).

Commit to doing one technique several times a day. Share the technique you will focus on with your facilitator and peers. What did you learn from this experience?
