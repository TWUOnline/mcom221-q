# Unit 5: The Grammar of Film

## Overview

We go back to theory in this unit and then have a chance to practice and apply it.

When we watch a film or TV show most people have no idea how much work and detail it took to make the production. Nor do they know the rules, guidelines, principles, and practices that were followed to create it. This unit and the ones following will help you explore what these best practices are and understand how to apply them to your work.
