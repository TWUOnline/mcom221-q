## Topic 3: Camera Angles and Heights

Camera heights and angles reveal both text and subtext. That is, they show us what is being filmed (the object or subject) and often convey something about the meaning of the subject or object (the subtext).

In essence, there are no “neutral” camera angles. Our camera height placement will convey something and it is important for the filmmaker to know what that something is.

The different camera heights include:

  - Eye-Level
  - Low Angle
  - High Angle
  - Shoulder Level
  - Hip Level
  - Knee Level Shot
  - Ground Level
  - Worm’s Eye View 
  - Bird’s Eye View
  - God’s Eye View
  - Dutch Tilt or Dutch Canted Angle
