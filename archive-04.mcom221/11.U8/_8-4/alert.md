#### Activity 8.4: Brainstorm and Prepare Your Pitch

Brainstorm either alone or with a partner and come up with a story concept to pitch to the class. The goal of this activity is to do find a compelling story and to pitch it in a way that will attract the teammates you will need to make your longer film.

Helpful Hint: Sometimes a title for your film can lend lots of inspiration. Professional screenwriters and Hollywood spend a lot of time finding the right title that captures the spirit of the film and can aid in marketing. Think *Rebel Without A Cause, Slum Dog Millionaire, Vertigo, Dumb and Dumber, The
Haunting, Groundhog Day, When Harry Met Sally.*


To prepare for your pitch make sure you:
  - Know your genre. The story above could be a comedy, a drama, thriller, or a horror film. Which genre you decide will determine the following.
  - Establish your main characters.
  - Establish the main conflict.
  - Escalate the conflict.
  - Create some of the obstacles that will have to be overcome.
  - Have a clear beginning, middle, and end.
  - Know what crew members you will need and what they will do, e.g., a screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, editor, etc.

Make sure the story is compressed, a la Aristotle’s *Poetics*, with a limited number of characters, locations, and action.

Helpful Hint: Most of the short films that won or where nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film follow Aristotle’s idea of great drama and comedy: a few characters and locations and action that takes place over a brief amount of time. For a list of nominees and winners see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Live_Action_Short_Film"> Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. </a>

Also be prepared to explain what crew members you will need and what they need to do.

Make your pitch to your classmates and then see who wants to join which team.

If your project is not chosen, that is, no one wants to work on it with you, you can still do it but know that it will be a lot of work.


### Guidelines for Pitching a Film Project

**Purpose of a Pitch:** To get people to work on your project, commission your
project, fund your project, help with your project, distribute your project,
etc. Pitches also help you to clarity what you want to do and why.

**Steps to a Good Pitch**

1.  If you can, open with a teaser or dramatic statement or question.

2.  Meet and greet your audience—minimum chitchat, professionals are busy, busy
    people.

3.  Dress appropriately—relative to the audience and the project. Artists dress
    “artsy”; corporate people dress with business attire.

4.  Project the proper persona (your personality and character)—knowledgeable,
    credible, trustworthy, smart, clever, etc.

5.  Explain your qualifications, background, and why you are competent and the
    right person to do the project. If you do not have a demo reel then sell
    people with your passion, e.g., WHIPLASH filmmaker.

6.  Give the title of the film/project—titles shape perception and expectations.

7.  State the Genre—comedy, drama, documentary, etc. This also shapes
    perceptions and expectations. The basic concept of a comedy should make us
    laugh or at lease smile.

8.  Give the Unique Angle or Hook of your project—what makes it stand out as
    something different and catchy/edgy/clever, etc. E.g., SHOE IN LOVE, a
    romantic comedy from the POV of a pair of cowboy boots and stilettos falling
    in love with each other. The special angle concept is to use foot ware as
    the main characters and the execution hook is to shoot POVs at foot level or
    from the shin down.

9.  Briefly state the logline or basic concept: a one or two sentence
    description of the core story. E.g., a young, bored dirt farmer gets a
    message that he has to help rescue a faraway princes and save the universe.
    STAR WARS.

10. Project synopsis—succinctly tell the beginning/middle/end of your story or
    if a documentary the main message of your doc.

11. Summarize your end goal: to wow my audience with extraordinary nature
    photography or to make my audience laugh, cry, fall in love, etc.

12. Explain what you need—cast, crew, funding, etc.

13. Ask for Questions—also be open to criticism and constructive comments and
    feedback.

14. Gratitude—be thankful and gracious even if your project is not received well
    or as anticipated. Burning bridges is wrongheaded. Pitching can be a
    training ground for how to deal with rejection.

*Examples of Types of Montage Projects to Pitch*

The goal of your Montage Short assignment (see the syllabus) will be to explore how to make an effective montage-based film that uses picture and sound editing to convey meaning, emotion, story and/or mood.

For this project, you can:

:fa-minus: Create a music video where you take a song and create images that
        express the mood, feeling, meaning, etc. of the song.

:fa-minus: Find a poem, fairy tale, or passage from the Bible and “visualize” and
        enhance it with music and sound effects.

:fa-minus: Create a chase scene—someone steals something and is on the run and
        using music and sound effects to enhance the excitement and dynamism.

:fa-minus: Create a love or horror or thriller story —use can use dialogue but
        there must be an edited montage—a series of edited shots that convey the
        mood, meaning etc.

:fa-minus: Etc.
