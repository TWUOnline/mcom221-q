#### Activity 8.5: Creating a Scriptment

For an overview of scriptments, consult this resource: <a href="https://screencraft.org/2018/02/27/outlines-treatments-and-scriptments-oh-my/"> Outlines, Treatments, and Scriptments, Oh My\! </a> by Ken Miyamoto.

As you do other drafts (good writing involves a lot of re-writing) to improve your story and polish your script so that everything is clear, it is helpful to ask the following questions. (These questions are designed for a fiction narrative film, though some of them can help vet your documentary or experimental film.) You might not have answers to all of them but you should for most of them. Again the emphasis in on helping you to be clear about your project.

  - Do I have the right genre?
  - Do I have a hook or is there something unique and fascinating about my story? Itâ€™s special angle.
  - Is the story clear? A solid beginng, middle, and end?
  - Do I focus on only a few characters and limited locations?
  - Are my action and conflict unified and focused?
  - Does my main character have a goal?
  - Is there an antagonist who or which wants to thwart that goal? (Remember, weather or a dog can be an antagonist.)
  - Are their stakes or consequences for not obtaining the goal?
  - Are there interesting obstacles to obtaining the goal?
  - Do I have a set-up of the main character, problem, goal, and antagonist?
  - Do I have some unexpected and unpredictable twists and turns in the middle section of my story?
  - Is there a main conflict or battle that determines whether the main character gets his or her goal?
  - Do I have a satisfying ending? (Remember not all endings have to be happy or closed. Open-ended endings are not resolved and make the audience guess, debate, and discuss what happened or might happen after.

Once you have your team and have developed the scriptment for your story, you can begin pre-production to get everything in place to film your project: e.g., cast, locations, props, gear, shooting schedule, etc.
