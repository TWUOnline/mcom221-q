## Topic 7: Steps for Creating Your Montage

Once you have your montage project and team in place, you are ready to make your montage. As we have seen, there are three main phases of film production and they will apply here:
  - Montage Pre-Production
  - Montage Production
  - Montage Post-Production

The lionâ€™s share of the emphasis in the chapter has been on post-production, but this does not mean you must take lightly your pre-production and production work. Your montage will only be as good as the images you have for it.
