Are you happy with your story? Do you have to make revisions? You should go through at least three drafts of your story to make sure it works. Test your story out on your family and friends. Ask them if it works but remember they are not filmmakers or professional critics so ignore things when they are too petty or too subjective.

Read through the section in Chapter 6 on creating a Short Story Film Template. Be sure to lay out your story in single lines of action that can be filmed as in the example of PANIC in Chapter 6.
